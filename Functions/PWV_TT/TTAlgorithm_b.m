function [TT, t_foot, indmaxs] = TTAlgorithm_b(signal,f,algorithm,waveform,continuous,show)
% Description:
%   TTAlgorithm applies user defined pulse wave analysis algorithms in
%   order to determine the transit time between two wave forms.  This
%   software assumes that the two waveforms are measured simultaneously,
%   and no temporal alignment is needed.
% Features:
% - Foot to foot algorithm
% - Foot to foot radius algorithm
% - Cross correlation of the entire cycle
% - Least Squares
% 
% signal - matrix with two physiological waveform vectors
% f - signal freqency (Hz), (note the frequency of the Test Doppler Data was 100Hz)
% algorithm - 1, 2, 3, or 4 refering to the above algorithms respectively
% waveform - 1, or 2, referring to pressure/area or velocity/flow respectively
% continuous - 0, or 1, indicating a single wave (0) or multiple waves (1)
% show - display location of 'feet' used for analysis, (1=yes, 0=no)
% TT - vector of transit times, length depends on number of waveforms
