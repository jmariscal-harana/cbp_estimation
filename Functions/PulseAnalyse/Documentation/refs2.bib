abstract = {Background Carotid stiffening is considered a key element in the pathogenesis of stroke. However, results of studies evaluating the association between carotid stiffness and incident stroke have been inconsistent. Objectives This study investigated whether carotid stiffness (as determined by ultrasonography) is associated with incident stroke and whether this association is independent of aortic stiffness as estimated by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV). Additionally, we evaluated the incremental value of carotid stiffness for stroke risk prediction beyond Framingham risk factors and cfPWV. Methods This study included a systematic review and meta-analyses of aggregate and individual participant data (IPD), the latter of which was obtained by requesting individual-level data of all cohort studies with available data on carotid stiffness and cfPWV. Results Ten studies (n = 22,472) were included in the aggregate data meta-analysis and 4 (n = 4,540) in the IPD meta-analysis. After adjusting for cardiovascular (CV) factors, the aggregate data meta-analysis showed that greater carotid stiffness (per SD) was associated with stroke (hazard ratio: 1.18; 95{\%} confidence interval: 1.05 to 1.33). In addition, carotid stiffness was associated with total CV events and CV and all-cause mortality, but not with coronary heart disease events. In the IPD meta-analysis, additional adjustment for cfPWV did not materially change these associations. Carotid stiffness did improve stroke risk prediction beyond Framingham and cfPWV (integrative discrimination improvement: 0.4 percentage point [95{\%} confidence interval: 0.1 to 0.6 percentage point] and continuous net reclassification improvement: 18.6{\%} [95{\%} confidence interval: 5.8{\%} to 31.3{\%}]). Conclusions Carotid stiffness is associated with incident stroke independently of CV factors and aortic stiffness. In addition, carotid stiffness improves stroke risk prediction beyond Framingham and aortic stiffness.},

abstract = {Propagation of the pressure wave along the arterial tree (pulse wave velocity [PWV]) is related to the intrinsic elasticity of the arterial wall. PWV is increased in stiffer arteries and, when measured over the aorta, is an independent predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Given the predictive power of PWV, identifying strategies that prevent or reduce stiffening may be important in prevention of cardiovascular events. One view is that aortic stiffness occurs as a result of atherosclerosis along the aorta. However, there is little or no association between PWV and classical risk factors for atherosclerosis, other than age and blood pressure. Furthermore, PWV does not increase during early stages of atherosclerosis, as measured by intima-media thickness and non-calcified atheroma, but it does increase in the presence of aortic calcification that occurs within advanced atherosclerotic plaque. Age-related widening of pulse pressure is the major cause of age-related increase in prevalence of hypertension and has been attributed to arterial stiffening. This review summarizes the methods of measuring aortic stiffness in humans, the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to aortic stiffness, including its association with atherosclerosis, and the haemodynamic consequences of increased aortic stiffness.},

abstract = {The digital volume pulse can be recorded simply and noninvasively by photoplethysmography. The objective of the present study was to determine whether a generalized transfer function can be used to relate the digital volume pulse to the peripheral pressure pulse and, hence, to determine whether both volume and pressure pulse waveforms are influenced by the same mechanism. The digital volume pulse was recorded by photoplethysmography in 60 subjects (10 women, aged 24 to 80 years), including 20 subjects with previously diagnosed hypertension. Simultaneous recordings of the peripheral radial pulse and digital artery pulse were obtained by applanation tonometry and a servocontrolled pressure cuff (Finapres), respectively. In 20 normotensive subjects, measurements were obtained after the administration of nitroglycerin (NTG, 500 microgram sublingually). Transfer functions obtained by Fourier analysis of the waveforms were similar in normotensive and hypertensive subjects. In normotensive subjects, transfer functions were similar before and after NTG. By use of a single generalized transfer function for all subjects, the radial and digital artery pressure waveforms could be predicted from the volume pulse with an average root mean square error of 4.4+/-2.0 and 4.3+/-1.9 mm Hg (mean+/-SD) for radial and digital artery waveforms, respectively, similar to the error between the 2 pressure waveforms (4.4+/-1.4 mm Hg). The peripheral pressure pulse is related to the digital volume pulse by a transfer function, which is not influenced by effects of hypertension or NTG. Effects of NTG on the volume pulse and pressure pulse are likely to be determined by a similar mechanism.},

In contrast, there was no relationship between age and Doppler PA flow velocity measurements. Although there was no relationship between BSA and Doppler aortic flow measurements, PA peak flow velocity and average acceleration increased, while acceleration time decreased with increasing BSA (all p less than 0.02).

abstract = {Peripheral vascular disease is a frequently occurring disease and is most often caused by atherosclerosis and more rarely by anomalies of the collagen or other components of the arterial wall. Arterial stiffness problems form one of the precursor phenomena of peripheral vascular disease, and in the case of atherosclerosis represents an independent risk marker for the occurrence of cardiovascular disease. The first techniques, developed to evaluate arterial stiffness, use indirect measurements such as pulse wave velocity or the analysis of variations in pressure and volume to estimate arterial wall stiffness. Techniques based on the pulse wave lack precision because they assume that arterial stiffness is uniform throughout the path of the pulse wave, and that it is constant throughout the cardiac cycle. Moreover, measuring the velocity of the pulse wave may be less precise in certain pathological situations: metabolic syndrome, obesity, large chest, mega-dolico artery. Techniques based on the analysis of variations in pressure and in volume do not accurately measure blood pressure, which can only be taken externally. In addition, these techniques require dedicated equipment, which is not reimbursed by the French health care system, and which is cumbersome to use (especially for techniques based on variation in pressure) in clinical practice. This explains why these two techniques are not used in clinical practice. Ultrafast echography is a new ultrasound imaging method that can record up to 10,000 images per second. This high temporal resolution makes it possible tomeasure the velocity of the local pulse wave and arterial wall stiffness thanks to the remote palpation carried out by shear wave. The ease of use and the accuracy of these two techniques suggest that these diagnostic applications will play a significant role in vascular pathology in the future. It is possible in real time, using a traditional vascular ultrasound probe, to make an accurate assessment of local arterial stiffness and of its variation during the cardiac cycle. This technological breakthrough will probably improve phenotype evaluation of patients suffering from vascular diseases, to more effectively evaluate the cardiovascular risk for patients, at primary and secondary prevention level, and to carry out broad epidemiological studies on cardiovascular risks. ?? 2013 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS on behalf of the ??ditions fran??aises de radiologie.},

abstract = {Background: Arterial stiffness is a known predictor of cardiovascular disease, and has also been associated with markers of cerebral small vessel disease as well as poor cognitive function and cognitive decline. The consistency of these associations and their relationship to each other are unclear. Method: We conducted a systematic review of the evidence associating arterial stiffness with cognitive function and cognitive decline, and with makers of cerebral small vessel disease, specifically lacunar infarcts and white matter hyperintensities. Results: Thirteen cross-sectional studies examining arterial stiffness and white matter hyperintensities or lacunar infarctions reported a positive association between increased arterial stiffness and radiological findings of cerebral small vessel disease. Two longitudinal studies examining the relationship between arterial stiffness and white matter hyperintensities found increased pulse wave velocity to be an independent predictor of white matter hyperintensity volume. Fifteen cross-sectional and seven longitudinal studies examining arterial stiffness and cognition were identified. Fourteen of the fifteen cross-sectional studies associated increased arterial stiffness with lower cognitive function, and six of the seven longitudinal studies found arterial stiffness to be predictive of cognitive decline. Conclusion: Arterial stiffness is associated with cerebral small vessel disease and decreased cognitive function. However methodological limitations such as differing covariates between studies and an over-reliance on the MMSE to measure cognition are a concern across much of the literature. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Whereas mean arterial pressure is known to be identical in all parts of the arterial tree, pulse pressure was significantly lower in the carotid (52.7 +/- 2.2 mm Hg) than in the brachial (62.0 +/- 2.0 mm Hg) or femoral (62.5 +/- 2.5 mm Hg) arteries. Despite a higher pulse pressure and diastolic diameter, the femoral artery had a lower pulsatile change in diameter (3.47 +/- 0.18{\%} versus 6.07 +/- 0.28{\%}; p {\textless} 0.0001) and distensibility coefficient (9.36 +/- 0.58 versus 21.60 +/- 1.75 x 10(-3) kPa-1) than the carotid artery.

abstract = {CVD prevention remains an important issue in public health and preventive cardiology. Favorable age-adjusted trends in decreasing CVD incidence and better control of CVD1 and hypertension72 have been documented, a possible reflection of improving conditions for newborns and children in theWestern world. There is, however, the dilemma to either go for more extensive blood sampling in a never-ending pursuitof new clinical risk markers4 with less and less addition to the estimation of the overall risk or to develop better methods forevaluating EVA and TOD. The ultimate goal is to find more effective ways for CVD prevention via ADAM (Figure 3). Current guidelines propose intensified risk factor control in patients at particularly high risk, eg, patients with diabetesmellitus and established CVD. Because the risk often remains high in spite of therapeutic efforts at this late stage, ourconclusion is that new intervention trials are needed for early CVD prevention, based on screening for EVA in high-riskpatients, eg, those with a positive family history for CVD or impaired glucose metabolism. In families with a high risk for premature myocardial infarction and stroke, there is also a fair chance of finding family members with early signs of CV aging. From both an ethical and a clinical perspective, it is fully acceptable to reach out and invite these individuals for a careful examination of CV risk factors, EVA, and other manifestations of TOD. Personal advice to improve lifestyle should be given and, in many cases, also targeted drug interventions according to guidelines. In conclusion, the concept of EVA and ADAM, which represents a development of ideas that have been around for a few years,73,74 should benefit from the development of new methodologies, eg, PWV measurements, and the use of leukocyte telomere DNA as a marker of vascular telomere DNA75 and risk of hypertension,76 guiding novel therapeutic approaches. 2009 American Heart Association, Inc.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, a predictor of cardiovascular outcome, is conventionally measured using a tonometer sequentially placed upon the carotid and femoral arteries, gated using an electrocardiogram. Leg cuff detection of the femoral pulse removes the need for signal gating, reduces the time required for a single measurement, but gives different pulse wave velocity values to tonometric analysis. A novel algorithm to correct for the transit time and distance related to the additional femoral segment was applied to the cuff-based approach in this study. METHOD: Eighty-eight individuals were recruited across four centres and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity measured in triplicate using two operators with both a tonometer-based device and a device using an inflated thigh cuff with and without the use of the novel algorithm. Comparison was made by Bland-Altman and regression analysis. RESULTS: The unadjusted cuff-based approach gave lower pulse wave velocity values than the tonometer-based approach (6.11 ± 1.27 and 7.02 ± 1.88 m/s, P {\textless} 0.001). With application of the algorithm, the cuff-based device gave similar pulse wave velocity values (7.04 ± 1.72 m/s) as the tonometer-based approach (P = 0.86). Analysis of covariance with age showed a difference between the tonometer and cuff-based methods (P {\textless} 0.001), with a dependence upon age (P = 0.004). The adjusted cuff-based method gave similar results to the tonometer-based method (P = 0.94), with no dependence upon age (P = 0.46). CONCLUSION: This study provided validation of a cuff-based assessment of carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity against the universally accepted tonometric method. Adjusting the cuff-based method for the additional femoral segment measured gives results comparable to the tonometer-based method, for which the majority of population data exist to date.},

abstract = {Aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) and augmentation index are independent predictors of adverse cardiovascular events, including mortality. In hypertension and aging, central elastic arteries become stiffer, diastolic pressure decreases, and central systolic and pulse pressures are augmented due to increased PWV and early return of reflected waves to the heart from the periphery. Valuable information on arterial properties such as stiffness can be obtained from both central (aortic) and peripheral (radial artery) pressure waveforms, but absolute values of wave reflection amplitude and wasted left ventricular (LV) pressure energy can only be obtained from the central arterial pressure waveform. As the arterial system becomes stiffer, there is a marked increase in central systolic and pulse pressures and wasted LV energy, along with a decrease in pulse pressure amplification. The increase in aortic systolic and pulse pressures are due primarily to increases in PWV and wave reflection amplitude with a small increase in incident wave amplitude. In individuals with very stiff elastic arteries (eg, in older persons with isolated systolic hypertension), there is a decrease in diastolic pressure. These changes in pressure components increase LV afterload and myocardial oxygen demand and therefore cause an undesirable mismatch between ventricle emptying and arterial pulse wave transmission, which promotes ventricular hypertrophy. High systolic and pulse pressures resulting from advanced age or hypertension increase circumferential arterial wall stress, which likely causes breakdown of medial elastin and increases the possibility of local fatigue, endothelial damage and development of atherosclerosis. Vasodilator drugs may have little direct effect on large central elastic arteries, but at the same time, their effects on peripheral muscular arteries reduce wave reflection amplitude and markedly lower systolic and pulse pressures and ventricular afterload. These beneficial effects on central arterial pressure can occur with or without a reduction in cuff blood pressure (BP) and may explain the apparent "pressure- independent" effects of drugs such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. Therefore, optimal treatment of high BP and its complications should include consideration of arterial stiffness, augmentation of aortic pressure, and LV wasted energy, all of which should be reduced to the lowest possible level. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd.},

abstract = {Physiological changes occur with aging in all organ systems. The cardiac output decreases, blood pressure increases and arteriosclerosis develops. The lungs show impaired gas exchange, a decrease in vital capacity and slower expiratory flow rates. The creatinine clearance decreases with age although the serum creatinine level remains relatively constant due to a proportionate age-related decrease in creatinine production. Functional'changes, largely related to altered motility patterns, occur in the gastrointestinal system with senescence, and atrophic gastritis and altered hepatic drug metabolism are common in the elderly. Progressive elevation of blood glucose occurs with age on a multifactorial basis and osteoporosis is frequently seen due 'to a linear decline in bone mass after the fourth decade. The epidermis of the skin atrophies with age and due to changes in collagen and elastin the skin loses its tone and elasticity. Lean body mass declines with ag'e and this is primarily due to loss and atrophy of muscle cells. Degenerative changes occur in many joints and this, combined with the loss of muscle mass, inhibits elderly patients locomotion. These changes with age have important practical implications for the clinical management of elderly patients: metabolism is altered, changes in response to commonly used drugs make different drug dosages necessary and there is need for rational preventive programs of diet and exercise in an effort to delay or reverse some of these changes. NORMAL AGING affects all physiological processes. Subtle irreversible changes in the function of most organs can be shown to occur by the third and fourth decades of life, with progressive deteriora- tion with age. The rapidity of the decline in func-tion varies with the organ system under consid-eration but is relatively constant within a given system. Thus, the rate of aging is the same for a 45-year-old man as it is for an 85-year-old man; the difference is that by 85 years of age more age-related changes have accumulated. An important concept not widely appreciated is the distinction that must be made between the normal attrition of function occurring in all persons with advancing age and the loss of function that marks the onset},

abstract = {Background: We examined different characteristics of the second derivative of the finger photoplethysmogram (SDPTG) and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (BAPWV) for assessing arterial function in a large general population, along with the alteration of SDPTG in hypertension. Methods: Finger SDPTG and BAPWV were measured in 848 (544 normotensive and 304 untreated hypertensive) subjects 34 to 88 years of age. For assessing SDPTG, we calculated the B:A and D:A ratios and the aging index (AGI), based on the height of the wave components. Using univariate and multivariate analyses, determinants of SDPTG indices and BAPWV as well as differences between normotensive and hypertensive subjects were evaluated. Results: We found that BAPWV was independently and positively correlated with age, blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and hemoglobin A 1c. The D:A ratio and AGI showed a positive and the B:A ratio a negative independent correlation with age and BP. In contrast, the D:A ratio and AGI showed a negative and the B:A ratio a positive correlation with HR. The SDPTG indices, but not BAPWV, were independently associated with gender. The multivariate-adjusted D:A ratio, AGI, and BAPWV were significantly higher and the adjusted B:A ratio was lower in hypertensive than in normotensive subjects, and hypertensive subjects showed two-fold greater adjusted risks of having high D:A and low B:A ratios. The SDPTG indices and BAPWV were mildly correlated with each other in normotensive but not in untreated hypertensive subjects. Conclusion: Although the SDPTG depends on various factors in a manner different from BAPWV, it may be useful for detecting vascular aging accelerated by hypertension. ?? 2005 American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd.},

abstract = {The growing interest in the clinical measurement of arterial aging through the noninvasive assessment of arterial stiffness is associated with important developments in novel methods and apparatus. In this review, we aimed to describe the major principles of the measurement of arterial stiffness and to critically review the advantages and limitations of the different methods. The measurement of regional stiffness is recommended by international guidelines for routine clinical practice. It is most often determined through pulse wave velocity (PWV) between 2 arterial sites. Methods using a single-site cuff-based measurement are promising. Local determination of arterial stiffness, obtained either with the well-established, high-resolution echo tracking systems or more recently with magnetic resonance imaging, is indicated for pathophysiological and pharmacologic studies. Novel apparatus that were developed for determining arterial stiffness claimed superiority over pioneering methods either through greater simplicity of use, better repeatability, or a more pertinent arterial pathway. However, the true additive value of measuring arterial aging with a given apparatus had to be translated into the predictive value of arterial stiffness as an intermediate end point, ie, the higher the arterial stiffness the higher the number of cardiovascular (CV) events. Thus, another important aim of this review was to analyze the amount of epidemiologic evidence obtained with a given method regarding the predictive value of arterial stiffness for CV events.},

abstract = {To assess the effect of age on cardiac volumes and function in the absence of overt or occult coronary disease, we performed serial gated blood pool scans at rest and during progressive upright bicycle exercise to exhaustion in 61 participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. The subjects ranged in age from 25 to 79 years and were free of cardiac disease according to their histories and results of physical, resting and stress electrocardiographic, and stress thallium scintigraphic examinations. Absolute left ventricular volumes were obtained at each workload. There were no age-related changes in cardiac output, end-diastolic or end-systolic volumes, or ejection fraction at rest. During vigorous exercise (125 W), cardiac output was not related to age (cardiac output [1/min] = 16.02 + 0.03 [age]; r = .12, p = .46). However, there was an age-related increase in end-diastolic volume (end-diastolic volume [ml] = 86.30 + 1.48 [age]; r = .47, p = .003) and stroke volume (stroke volume [ml] = 85.52 + 0.80 [age]; r = .37, p = .02), and an age-related decrease in heart rate (heart rate [beats/min] = 184.66 - 0.70 [age]; r = -.50, p = .002). The dependence of the age-related increase in stroke volume on diastolic filling was emphasized by the fact that at this high workload end-systolic volume was higher (end-systolic volume [ml] = 3.09 + 0.65 [age]; r = .45, p = .003) and ejection fraction lower (ejection fraction = 88.48 - 0.18 [age]; r = -.33, p = .04) with increasing age. These findings indicate that although aging does not limit cardiac output per se in healthy community-dwelling subjects, the hemodynamic profile accompanying exercise is altered by age and can be explained by an age-related diminution in the cardiovascular response to beta-adrenergic stimulation.},

abstract = {Objective: Although contour analysis of pulse waves has been proposed as a non-invasive means in assessing arterial stiffness in atherosclerosis, accurate determination of the conventional parameters is usually precluded by distorted waveforms in the aged and atherosclerotic objects. We aimed at testing reliable indices in these patient populations. Methods: Digital volume pulse (DVP) curve was obtained from 428 subjects recruited from a health screening program at a single medical center from January 2007 to July 2008. Demographic data, blood pressure, and conventional parameters for contour analysis including pulse wave velocity (PWV), crest time (CT), stiffness index (SI), and reflection index (RI) were recorded. Two indices including normalized crest time (NCT) and crest time ratio (CTR) were also analysed and compared with the known parameters. Results: Though ambiguity of dicrotic notch precluded an accurate determination of the two key conventional parameters for assessing arterial stiffness (i.e. SI and RI), NCT and CTR were unaffected because the sum of CT and TDVP (i.e. the duration between the systolic and diastolic peak) tended to remain constant. NCT and CTR also correlated significantly with age, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, PWV, SI and RI (all P{\textless}0.01). Conclusion: NCT and CTR not only showed significant positive correlations with the conventional parameters for assessment of atherosclerosis (i.e. SI, RI, and PWV), but they also are of particular value in assessing degree of arterial stiffness in subjects with indiscernible peak of diastolic wave that precludes the use of conventional parameters in waveform contour analysis. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {A near-infrared finger photoplethysmogram adopting a wavelength of 810 nm provides data pertaining to the pulsatile a.c. component of finger blood flow (delta I) superimposed on the transmitted d.c. components in a normal ( I: tissue plus blood) and an ischaemic circulatory state ( I(t): tissue only). Simultaneous recording of finger blood pressure provides data pertaining to the distending pulse (PP) and mean blood pressure. Based on the Lambert-Beer law, indices of the arterial compliance (CI=delta I/ I/PP) and distensibility [DI=delta I/ I/ln( I(t)/ I)/PP] are advocated for assessing finger vasculature. The functional relationships between transmural pressure and CI and DI were examined using finger occlusion while performing an arithmetic test (i.e. a mental stress) in 16 females, and during reactive hyperaemia in 5. Gradual occlusion of the finger was conducted at 20-s intervals and the beat-by-beat transmural pressure was determined by calculating mean blood pressure minus the occluding cuff pressure. Logarithmically transformed CI and DI data were linearly associated with the transmural pressure; thus, the estimates obtained at a transmural pressure of 40 mmHg were chosen as an arbitrary reference point (CI40 and DI40). The results indicated that CI40 and DI40 were reduced while performing an arithmetic test, and increased during reactive hyperaemia. Responses were larger for CI40 than for DI40. In conclusion, noninvasive finger occlusion allowed the measurement of the compliance/distending pressure relationship, and CI40 could be utilised to evaluate changes in finger vascular tone.},

It provides an exhaustive description and analysis of time velocity waveforms, as well as the accurate estimation of local and regional aortic function and stiffness indices. The main functions implemented in this platform, running under MATLAB, include : 1) import of DICOM cine and flow data (including the specific headers needed for further analysis of data); 2) segmentation (manual or automatic) of axial sections of the aorta; 3) analysis of flow data and waveforms recorded in the segmented arterial lumens; 4) advanced comparison of flow data between the ascending and descending aorta, including an automatic estimation of the propagation speed of the velocity wave; 5) export of results to Excel data sheets. Here we describe specifically the automatic contouring of the aortic lumen integrated in this software. The method is based on a 3D snake deformable surface, modelling the evolution of aortic lumen with time; this allows the introduction of smoothness constraints both in the 2D image plan and the time axis. This cylindrical like surface is deformed under the influence of “external forces” including the classical attraction by the image gradient but also specific potentials to avoid the attraction of the contour by vascular structures surrounding the ascending aorta, such as the pulmonary artery and vena cava. The duration of this segmentation ranges from 5 seconds (descending aorta, True-FISP sequence, breathhold, square pixel size = 0.58 mm, 31 cardiac phases) to 35 seconds (ascending aorta, FISP-2D, free breathing, square pixel size = 0.37 mm, 51 cardiac phases) on a basic laptop. Figure 1 presents the evolution of the normalized area of the section in the ascending and descending aorta using the previously described True-FISP sequence. The software was successfully tested on various MR sources, including General Electric, Siemens and Philips 1.5 T and 3 T scanners, thus making possible the processing of multi vendor acquisitions in multi centric studies.},

The model can be applied to different anatomies of arterial networks and can simulate compression of arteries, these allowing us to simulate the modified Allen's test (MAT) and to assess its suitability for the detection of sufficient collateral flow in the hand if radial blood supply is interrupted. The test measures blood flow in the superficial palmar arch before and during compression of the radial artery. The absence of reversal flow in the palmar arch with the compression indicates insufficient collateral flow and is referred to as a positive MAT. This study shows that small calibres of the superficial palmar arch and insufficient compression of the radial artery can lead to false-positive results. Measurement of the drop in digital systolic pressures with compression of the radial artery has proved to be a more sensitive test to predict the presence of sufficient ulnar collateral flow in networks with small calibres of the superficial palmar arch. However, this study also shows that digital pressure measurements can fail in detecting enough collateral flow if the radial artery is insufficiently compressed.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Childhood obesity is associated with risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Arterial stiffness is considered one of the earliest detectable measures of vascular damage. There is controversy in the literature regarding the effects of childhood obesity on arterial stiffness. The objective of this study is to systematically review the literature and to conduct a meta-analysis comparing measures of central arterial stiffness in children and adolescents with obesity to healthy body mass index controls. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Literature searches were conducted using databases (eg, MEDLINE, EMBASE) and citations cross-referenced. Studies assessing central pulse wave velocity or $\beta$-stiffness index were included. A random effects meta-analysis of the standardized mean difference and 95{\%} confidence intervals in arterial stiffness between children with obesity and control children was performed for each arterial stiffness measure. A total of 523 studies were identified. Fifteen case-control studies were included, with 2237 children/adolescents (1281 with obesity, 956 healthy body mass index controls) between 5 and 24 years of age. All studies measuring carotid and aortic $\beta$-stiffness index and 10/12 studies measuring central pulse wave velocity reported greater arterial stiffness in children/adolescents with obesity compared with controls. A random effects meta-analysis was performed revealing a significant effect of obesity on pulse wave velocity (standardized mean difference=0.718; 95{\%} confidence interval=0.291-1.415), carotid $\beta$-stiffness index (0.862; 0.323-1.402), and aortic $\beta$ stiffness index (1.017; 0.419-1.615). CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that child/adolescent obesity is associated with greater arterial stiffness. However, further research is needed to address confounders, such as pubertal status, that may affect this relationship in children. In the future, these techniques may be useful in risk stratification and guiding clinical management of obese children to optimize cardiovascular outcomes.},

abstract = {Hydraulic transients in closed conduits have been a subject of both theoretical study and intense practical interest for more than one hundred years. While straightforward in terms of the one-dimensional nature of pipe networks, the full description of transient fluid flows pose interesting problems in fluid dynamics. For example, the response of the turbulence structure and strength to transient waves in pipes and the loss of flow axisymmetry in pipes due to hydrodynamic instabilities are currently not understood. Yet, such understanding is important for modeling energy dissipation and water quality in transient pipe flows. This paper presents an overview of both historic developments and present day research and practice in the field of hydraulic transients. In particular, the paper discusses mass and momentum equations for one-dimensional Flows, wavespeed, numerical solutions for one-dimensional problems, wall shear stress models; two-dimensional mass and momentum equations, turbulence models, numerical solutions for two-dimensional problems, boundary conditions, transient analysis software, and future practical and research needs in water hammer. The presentation emphasizes the assumptions and restrictions involved in various governing equations so as to illuminate the range of applicability as well as the limitations of these equations. Understanding the limitations of current models is essential for (i) interpreting their results, (ii) judging the reliability of the data obtained from them, (iii) minimizing misuse of water-hammer models in both research and practice, and (iv) delineating the contribution of physical processes from the contribution of numerical artifacts to the results of waterhammer models. There are 134 refrences cited in this review article.},

abstract = {The ubiquitous brachial cuff method gained widespread clinical acceptance for blood pressure recording after confirmation of its prognostic value in 1917. This method displaced radial pulse waveform analysis by sphygmography, which also gave prognostic Information but was difficult to use. Since that time, brachial cuff sphygmomanometry has migrated from the physician's office to 24-hour monitoring and home use, with electronic methods replacing the Korotkov sound technique for determining systolic and diastolic pressure. Detailed instrumental studies, required by regulatory bodies, revealed inaccuracies of all cuff methods for recording true intra-arterial pressure. A major source of inaccuracy in assessing left ventricular load is the amplification of the pressure wave in its transit from the central aorta to upper limb arteries, as extensively studied by Earl H. Wood at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn, in the 1950s. This limitation can be overcome by combining newer methods using radial artery waveform analysis in conjunction with conventional cuff sphygmomanometry to noninvasively measure the central aortic pressure waveforms. Recent studies using radial tonometry have proved that this is more effective than conventional manometry in predicting cardiovascular events and gauging response to therapy. Measurement of central as well as peripheral arterial pressure and physiology is becoming increasingly used as an office practice and a laboratory procedure.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Recently, new non-invasive vascular indexes named arterial velocity pulse index (AVI) and arterial pressure volume index (API), which is evaluated by a multifunctional blood pressure monitoring device, were developed using cuff oscillometric technologies and suprasystolic cuff oscillometric wave measurement. However, although a few studies including a computational model have been performed, data on subjects with cardiovascular diseases in actual outpatient clinics remain scant. METHODS We examined a total 252 consecutive outpatients and analyzed two vascular indexes with various clinical parameters to explore potential utilities of these two indexes in actual clinical settings. RESULTS Although we found that two indexes were correlated with each other, the clinical implications of these indexes seemed to differ. Our analyses showed that AVI significantly correlated with augmentation index, but not with flow-mediated dilatation, and multivariate analyses suggested that enhanced AVI represents increased workload on the heart with elevated central blood pressure. In contrast, although the results of analyses performed to identify clinical parameters independently related to API were obscure and non-specific, after adjustment for multiple clinical variables, API was found to be significantly and independently associated with both Framingham Cardiovascular Risk Score and the Suita Score, suggesting that API is a useful predictor of future cardiovascular events. CONCLUSIONS These two new vascular indexes might be useful in actual clinical settings to evaluate cardiovascular risks with various clinical backgrounds.},

abstract = {Arterial stiffness index is one of the biomechanical indices of vascular healthiness. These indexes are based on detailed pulse waveform analysis which is presented here. After photoplethysmographyic (PPG) pulse wave measurement, we decompose the pulse waveform for the estimation and determination of arterial elasticity. Firstly, it is electro-optically measured PPG signal and by electromechanical film (EMFi) measured signal that are analyzed and investigated by dividing each wave into five logarithmic normal function components. For both the PPG and EMFi waveform we can find very easily a good fit between the original and overlapped and summed wave components. Each wave component is assumed to resemble certain phenomenon in the arteries and certain indexes can be calculated for example based on the mutual timing of the components. Several studies have demonstrated that these kinds of indexes calculated based on actual biomechanical processed can predict future cardiovascular events. Many dynamic factors, e.g., arterial stiffness, depend on fixed structural features of the arterial wall. For more accurate description, arterial stiffness is estimated based on pulse wave decomposition analysis in the radial measured by EMFi and PPG method and tibial arterial walls measured by PPG method parallelly. Elucidation of the precise relationship between endothelial function and arterial stiffness can be done through biomechanics. However, arterial wall elasticity awaits still further biomechanical studies with clinical relations and the influence of arterial flexibility, resistance and ageing inside of the radial pulse waveform.},

abstract = {Pulse pressure rather than diastolic pressure is the best predictor of coronary heart disease risk in older subjects, but the converse is true in younger subjects. We hypothesized that this disparity results from an age-related difference in pressure amplification from the aorta to brachial artery. Data from 212 subjects age {\textless} 50 years and 230 subjects age {\textgreater} or =50 years were abstracted from a community database. All subjects were free from cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and medication. Peripheral blood pressure was assessed by sphygmomanometry. Radial artery waveforms recorded noninvasively by applanation tonometry were used to derive central blood pressure. Pressure amplification (peripheral/central pulse pressure ratio) was linearly related to age (r=0.7; P{\textless}0.001). There was an inverse, linear relationship between amplification and diastolic pressure in the younger group (r=0.3; P{\textless}0.001) but not in older subjects (r=0.1; P=0.2). There was no relationship in either group when the amplification ratio was calculated with nonaugmented central pressure. Amplification is reduced in older subjects because of enhanced wave reflection. In younger, but not older, subjects, amplification declines as diastolic pressure rises. Therefore, peripheral pulse pressure underestimates the effect that diastolic pressure has on central pulse pressure in younger subjects. This may explain why diastolic pressure is a better predictor of risk in this age group and suggests that assessment of central pressure may improve risk stratification further.},

abstract = {One-dimensional (1D) modeling is a powerful tool for studying haemodynamics; however, a comprehensive 1D model representing the entire cardiovascular system is lacking. We present a model that accounts for wave propagation in anatomically realistic systemic (including coronary and cerebral) arterial/venous networks, pulmonary arterial/venous networks and portal veins. A lumped parameter (0D) heart model represents cardiac function via a time-varying elastance and source resistance, and accounts for mechanical interactions between heart chambers mediated via pericardial constraint, the atrioventricular septum and atrioventricular plane motion. A non-linear windkessel-like 0D model represents microvascular beds, while specialized 0D models are employed for the hepatic and coronary beds. Model-derived pressure and flow waveforms throughout the circulation are shown to reproduce the characteristic features of published human waveforms. Moreover, wave intensity profiles closely resemble available in vivo profiles. Forward and backward wave intensity is quantified and compared along major arteriovenous paths, providing insights into wave dynamics in all of the major physiological networks. Interactions between cardiac function/mechanics and vascular waves are investigated. The model will be an important resource for studying the mechanics underlying pressure/flow waveforms throughout the circulation, along with global interactions between the heart and vessels under normal and pathological conditions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) adds significantly to traditional cardiovascular risk prediction, but is not widely available. Therefore, it would be helpful if cfPWV could be replaced by an estimated carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (ePWV) using age and mean blood pressure, and previously published equations. The aim of this study was to investigate whether ePWV could predict cardiovascular events independently of traditional cardiovascular risk factors and/or cfPWV. METHOD: cfPWV was measured and ePWV was calculated in 2366 patients from four age groups of the Danish MONICA10 cohort. Additionally, the patients were divided into four cardiovascular risk groups based on Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) or Framingham risk score (FRS). In 2006, the combined cardiovascular endpoint of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke and hospitalization for ischemic heart disease was registered. RESULTS: Most results were retested in 1045 hypertensive patients from a Paris cohort. Bland-Altman plot demonstrated a relative difference of -0.3{\%} [95{\%} confidence interval (CI) -15 to 17{\%}] between ePWV and cfPWV. In Cox regression models in apparently healthy patients, ePWV and cfPWV (per SD) added independently to SCORE in prediction of combined endpoint [hazard ratio (95{\%}CI) = 1.38(1.09-1.76) and hazard ratio (95{\%}CI) = 1.18(1.01-1.38)] and to FRS [hazard ratio (95{\%}CI) = 1.33(1.06-1.66) and hazard ratio (95{\%}CI) = 1.16(0.99-1.37)]. If healthy patients with ePWV and/or cfPWV at least 10 m/s were reclassified to a higher SCORE risk category, net reclassification index was 10.8{\%}, P less than 0.01. These results were reproduced in the Paris cohort. CONCLUSION: ePWV predicted major cardiovascular events independently of SCORE, FRS and cfPWV indicating that these traditional risk scores have underestimated the complicated impact of age and blood pressure on arterial stiffness and cardiovascular risk.},

abstract = {Measurement of arterial stiffness is assuming an increasing role in the clinical assessment of patients. Indeed, arterial stiffness and wave reflections are now well accepted as the most important determinants of increasing systolic and pulse pressure in our aging community, and thus as the cause of cardiovascular (CV) complications and events, including stroke and myocardial infarction. Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV), which is a direct measure of arterial stiffness, is the gold standard, since it requires little technical expertise and is supported by the greatest amount of epidemiological evidence. Indeed, aortic stiffness has independent predictive value for all-cause and CV mortality, CV disease, fatal and nonfatal coronary events and fatal strokes in patients with various levels of CV risk. Carotid pulse pressure and augmentation index are only indirect, surrogate measures of arterial stiffness. However, they provide additional information concerning wave reflections. They have demonstrated their predictive value in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Carotid stiffness was predictive of CV events in a small number of patients with ESRD or following renal transplantation, but had no independent predictive value in a larger number of patients with manifest arterial disease or in the healthy elderly patients of the Rotterdam study. To be not only an intermediate end point but also a surrogate end point, aortic stiffness has to demonstrate that its attenuation has an effect on CV mortality, coronary events and stroke. This remains to be established in populations at low to medium CV risk Eth i.e., with hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes and moderate chronic kidney disease.},

abstract = {Age is the dominant risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. However, until recently, convincing mechanistic or molecular explanations for the increased cardiovascular risks conferred by aging have been elusive. Aging is associated with alterations in a number of structural and functional properties of large arteries, including diameter, wall thickness, wall stiffness, and endothelial function. Emerging evidence indicates that these age-associated changes are also accelerated in the presence of cardiovascular diseases, and that these changes are themselves risk factors for the appearance or progression of these diseases. In this review, the evidence demonstrating that arterial aging is accelerated in cardiovascular diseases and that accelerated arterial aging is a risk factor for adverse cardiovascular outcomes is briefly reviewed, and selected advances in vascular biology that provide insights into the mechanisms that may underlie the increased risks conferred by arterial aging are summarized. Remarkably, a host of biochemical, enzymatic, and cellular alterations that are operative in accelerated arterial aging have also been implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of arterial diseases. These vascular alterations are thus putative candidates that could be targeted by interventions aimed at attenuating arterial aging, similar to the lifestyle and pharmacological interventions that have already been proven effective. Therefore, the notion that aging is a chronological process and that its risky components cannot be modulated is no longer tenable. It is our hope that a greater appreciation of the links between arterial aging and cardiovascular diseases will stimulate further investigation into strategies aimed at preventing or retarding arterial aging.},

Endothelial dysfunction: a marker of atherosclerotic risk. 2003;23:168 –175. Abstract—Investigation of arterial stiffness, especially of the large arteries, has gathered pace in recent years with the development of readily available noninvasive assessment techniques. These include the measurement of pulse wave velocity, the use of ultrasound to relate the change in diameter or area of an artery to distending pressure, and analysis of arterial waveforms obtained by applanation tonometry. Here, we describe each of these techniques and their limitations and discuss how the measured parameters relate to established cardiovascular risk factors and clinical outcome. We also consider which techniques might be most appropriate for wider clinical application. Finally, the effects of current and future cardiovascular drugs on arterial stiffness are also discussed, as is the relationship between arterial elasticity and endothelial function.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Simple reproducible methods of measuring arterial stiffness, a powerful index of prognosis, are becoming available. AIM: To compare the pulse wave transit time (TT) and pulse wave velocity (PWV) between MRI and an arm cuff-based oscillometric method, the Arteriograph. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MRI phase-contrast data were acquired at the aortic arch and just above the aortic bifurcation in 49 men (age 53+/-6 years). Supine left-arm Arteriograph measurements were made after MRI using the surface sternal notch to symphysis pubis pathway length. RESULTS: MRI TT and PWV covered 86{\%} of aortic root-bifurcation length omitting a mean 4.7 cm of proximal ascending aorta. Arteriograph TT (71+/-9 ms) was 6.6 ms [95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 3.9-9.4] or 10{\%} higher than MRI (64+/-10 ms). Arteriograph PWV (7.9+/-1.3 m/s) was 1.33 m/s (95{\%} CI 0.95-1.70) higher than MRI (6.6+/-1.2 m/s), primarily because the surface aortic length was 70 mm (95{\%} CI 59-81) longer than MRI. Arteriograph-MRI PWV difference decreased to 0.31 m/s (95{\%} CI 0.01-0.61) when Arteriograph PWV was calculated using the MRI aortic path length and to 0.25 m/s (95{\%} CI -0.05 to 0.55) after correcting for the aortic segments omitted in the MRI method. After similar TT corrections for MRI, the Arteriograph-MRI difference in TT reduced to 3.2 ms (95{\%} CI 0.2-6). CONCLUSION: TT estimations by Arteriograph and MRI are close. More accurate length estimation from MRI-derived models improves Arteriograph PWV measurement.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) reference ranges have not been well established in Chinese. Here we determined normal cardiac and aortic reference ranges in healthy Singaporean Chinese and investigated how these data might affect clinical interpretation of CMR scans.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: In 180 healthy Singaporean Chinese (20 to 69 years old; males, n = 91), comprehensive cardiac assessment was performed using the steady state free precision technique (3T Ingenia, Philips) and images were analysed by two independent observers (CMR42, Circle Cardiovascular Imaging). Measurements were internally validated using standardized approaches: left ventricular mass (LVM) was measured in diastole and systole (with and without papillary muscles) and stroke volumes were compared in both ventricles. All reference ranges were stratified by sex and age; and "indeterminate/borderline" regions were defined statistically at the limits of the normal reference ranges. Results were compared with clinical measurements reported in the same individuals.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: LVM was equivalent in both phases (mean difference 3.0 ± 2.5 g; P = 0.22) and stroke volumes were not significantly different in the left and right ventricles (P = 0.91). Compared to females, males had larger left and right ventricular volumes (P {\textless} 0.001 for all). Indexed LVM was significantly higher in males compared to females (50 ± 7 versus 38 ± 5 g/m(2), respectively; P {\textless} 0.001). Overall, papillary muscles accounted for only {\~{}}2 {\%} of the total LVM. Indexed atrial sizes and aortic root dimensions were similar between males and females (P {\textgreater} 0.05 for all measures). In both sexes, age correlated negatively with left and right ventricular volumes; and positively with aortic sinus and sinotubular junction diameters (P {\textless} 0.0001 for all). There was excellent agreement in indexed stroke volumes in the left and right ventricles (0.1±5.7mL/m(2), 0.7±6.2 mL/m(2), respectively), LVM (0.6±6.4g/m(2)), atrial sizes and aortic root dimensions between values reported in clinical reports and our measured reference ranges.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive sex and age-corrected CMR reference ranges at 3T have been established in Singaporean Chinese. This is an important step for clinical practice and research studies of the heart and aorta in Asia.},

Fasting serum lipid levels and overnight Na+ and K+ urinary excretion levels were determined in a subgroup of 104 subjects (ages 8 to 88 years). Comparisons were made with data obtained similarly from normal subjects in urban Beijing, an area with known high prevalence of hypertension.

abstract = {Background: Pulse wave velocity (PWV) is correlated with cardiovascular risk. This study presents a new method for measuring the arterial PWV by simultaneously recording the digital volume pulse through the finger and the toe by way of dual-channel photoplethysmography (PPG). Methods: In this study, 100 asymptomatic subjects (54 men and 46 women, 19 to 64 years of age) were enrolled. The PWV was measured both by dual-channel PPG (PWV-DVP) and by the standard method that current used applanation tonometry (PWV-AT). The developed dual-channel PPG system recorded digital volume pulse simultaneously from both the finger and toe. Time of pulse transition was measured on the time delay difference between two digital volume pulses. The PWV was calculated by dividing the distance between finger and toe by that of transit time. Results: The PWV-DVP was significantly correlated with PWV-AT (r = 0.678, P {\textless} .01). With multivariate analysis controlled for age, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure, PWV-DVP was still significantly correlated with PWV-AT (r = 0.669, P {\textless} .01). Subjects with hypertension and dyslipidemia had significant higher PWV detected by both methods. Conclusion: This study showed that PWV measured with dual-channel PPG system correlated very well with that measured using the traditional method. ?? 2005 American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd.},

abstract = {Objective: This study prospectively assessed the diagnostic accuracy of a novel bilateral photoplethysmography toe pulse measurement technique for the detection of significant lower limb peripheral arterial disease. Method: Bilateral photoplethysmography toe pulse measurements were compared with the ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) gold standard reference. Pulse wave analysis techniques extracted timing, amplitude, and shape characteristics for the great toes and their right-to-left side differences. These characteristics were compared with previously obtained normative ranges, and the accuracy was assessed for all significant disease (ABPI {\textless}0.9) and higher-grade disease (ABPI {\textless}0.5). Measurements were collected in a controlled environment within a tertiary vascular surgical unit for 111 subjects (age range, 42-91years), of whom 48 had significant lower limb peripheral arterial disease and 63 were healthy. Subjects were matched in age, sex, height, body mass index, and heart rate. Diagnostic performance was assessed using diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, negative-predictive and positive-predictive value, and the ?? statistic representing agreement between techniques beyond chance. Results: The degree that pulse shape fell beyond the normal range of normalized pulse shapes was at the threshold of substantial to almost perfect agreement compared with ABPI for significant disease detection (diagnostic accuracy, 91{\%} [?? = 0.80]; sensitivity, 93{\%}; specificity, 89{\%}), and with 90{\%} accuracy (?? = 0.65) for higher-grade disease detection. Pulse transit time differences between right and left toes also had substantial agreement with ABPI, with diagnostic accuracy of 86{\%} for significant disease detection (pulse transit time to pulse foot [?? = 0.71] and to pulse peak [?? = 0.70]) and reached at least 90{\%} for these for the higher-grade disease. The performance ranking for the different pulse features mirrored an earlier pilot study. With the shape and pulse transit time measurements, the negative-predictive values of the 5{\%} disease population screening-prevalence level were at least 99{\%} and had positive-predictive values of at least 98{\%} for the 90{\%} disease-prevalence level for vascular laboratory referrals. Conclusion: This simple-to-use technique could offer significant benefits for the diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease in settings such as primary care where noninvasive, accurate, and diagnostic techniques not requiring specialist training are desirable. Improved diagnosis and screening for peripheral arterial disease has the potential to allow identification and risk factor management for this high-risk group. ?? 2008 The Society for Vascular Surgery.},

The primary endpoint was the changes of carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) after treatment in 294 patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension untreated. Treatments tested were placebo (n = 88), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) (n = 75), calcium antagonists (n = 75), beta-blocker (n = 30), and diuretic (n = 26).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In the short-term and long-term trials, PWV decreased significantly by -0.75 and -1.3 m/s in the active treatment group compared with by +0.17 and -0.44 m/s in the placebo group, respectively. Active treatment was independently related to the changes in PWV and explained 5 and 4{\%} of the variance in the short-term and long-term trials, respectively. In the short-term trials, ACEIs were more effective than calcium antagonists and placebo on improving arterial stiffness.

abstract = {Thoracic aortic dilatation requires accurate and timely detection to prevent progression to thoracic aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection. The detection of thoracic aortic dilatation necessitates the availability of cut-off values for normal aortic diameters. Tools to evaluate aortic dimension above the root are scarce and inconsistent regarding age groups. The aim of this study was to provide reference values for aortic root and ascending aortic diameters on the basis of transthoracic echocardiographic measurements in a large cohort of children and adults. Diameters at the level of the sinuses of Valsalva (SoV) and ascending aorta (AA) were assessed with transthoracic echocardiography in 849 subjects (453 females, age range 1 to 85 years, mean 40.1 - 21.3 years) and measured according to published guidelines. Linear regression analysis was applied to create nomograms, as well as equations for upper limits of normal and z-scores. SoV and AA diameters were strongly correlated with age, body surface area (BSA), and weight (r [ 0.67 to 0.79, p {\textless}0.001 for all). Male subjects had significantly larger aortic dimensions at all levels in adulthood, even after BSA correction (p ???0.004 for all age intervals). Gender-, age-, and BSA-specific upper limits of normal and z-score equations were developed from a multivariate regression model, which strongly predicts SoV and AA diameters (adjusted R2 for SoV [ 0.84 and 0.67 and for AA [ 0.82 and 0.74, for male and female subjects, respectively). In conclusion, this study provides widely applicable reference values for thoracic aortic dilatation screening purposes. Age, BSA, and gender must be taken into account when assessing an individual patient.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increased arterial stiffness has been shown to be associated with coronary heart disease (CHD). However, it remains unclear as to whether the second derivative of the finger photoplethysmogram (SDPTG), a non-invasive method for the assessment of arterial stiffness, is useful for the estimation of risk of CHD in the general population. METHODS AND RESULTS: The SDPTG in 211 subjects (age: 63+/-15 years, range: 21-91 years, 93 males) was recorded without apparent atherosclerotic disorders from a community. The relationship between the SDPTG indices (b/a and d/a) and coronary risk factors (n=211) or the Framingham risk score (n=158, age: 60+/-12 years, range: 30-74 years, 63 males) were analyzed. The SDPTG indices significantly correlated with the Framingham risk score in both genders (b/a; r(male) =0.43, r(female) =0.54 and d/a; r(male) =-0.38, r(female) =-0.58), as well as several coronary risk factors. In the receiver operating characteristics curve analyses, the b/a discriminated high-risk subjects for CHD, who were in the highest quintile of the Framingham risk score in each gender, with a sensitivity and specificity of 0.85 and 0.58 in males and 0.83 and 0.72 in females, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the SDPTG is useful for the estimation of risk of CHD in the general population.},

abstract = {In the nineteenth century, prior to the introduction of the cuff sphygmomanometer, arteriosclerosis (stiffening of arteries) was recognized by clinicians and by life insurance companies as an indicator of vascular aging and cardiovascular risk, even in asymptomatic individuals. Through the twentieth century, views on aging came to focus on values of systolic and diastolic pressure and on obstructive atherosclerotic disease. Such focus deflected attention from the primary aging change which occurs in all societies, and is represented by stiffening and dilation of the proximal aorta. This review emphasizes the cushioning function of elastic arteries - principally the aorta - and how in youth this results in optimal interaction with the heart, and optimal steady flow through peripheral resistance vessels. Aortic stiffening with age is principally due to fatigue and fracture of elastin lamellae, with transfer of stress to stiffer collagenous components. Stiffening increases left ventricular load and myocardial blood requirement, but limits the capacity for blood supply during diastole. Consequences are cardiac failure and predisposition to ischaemia. The second, under-appreciated effect of aortic stiffening is transmission of flow pulsations downstream into vasodilated organs, principally brain and kidney, where pulsatile energy is dissipated and fragile microvessels are damaged. This accounts for micro infarcts and microhaemorrhages, with specialized cell damage, cognitive decline and renal failure. The aging process can be best monitored by change in the arterial pressure wave rather than by reliance on the cuff sphygmomanometer. This reintroduces the approaches by clinicians and life insurance examiners of the nineteenth century, endorses modern treatments for established disease, and holds the promise of detecting premature arterial degeneration, and better applying lifestyle measures and vasoactive medications to modify the aging process.},

abstract = {A comparative morphologic study of aortic changes with aging was conducted in different populations in an attempt to separate the effects of hypertension and atherosclerosis. Chinese and the occidental populations were chosen, as they are known to have a high prevalence of hypertension and atherosclerosis, respectively. Aortic tissue was collected from occidental (American and Australian) and Chinese populations from three geographic locations. Postmortem specimens were obtained from four fixed locations: ascending aorta (A), descending thoracic aorta (B), and abdominal aorta (suprarenal [C] and above the aortic bifurcation [D]). Histologic sections were used to measure aortic circumference, medial thickness, intimal thickness, and grade of atherosclerosis. Kidney sections were used to confirm the presence or absence of hypertension. A total of 302 cases (age range, 19 to 104 years; Male-to-female ration, 2:1) were studied: 112 Americans, 80 Australians, and 110 Chinese. Cases were divided into three age groups: 19 to 44; 45 to 64; and 65 years and older. The aortic circumference progressively decreased from sites A to D in all populations and age groups. The aortic circumference increased with age, and the increase was independent of the aortic location. When the populations were separated, however, the greater increase was at location A in the Chinese (P = .008) and locations D in the occidental (P = .13), a population contrast that was significant only in location A. Intimal thickness increased with advancing age and was maximal in the abdominal aorta. The population differences also were significant for intimal thickness and were significantly greater in the occidental population in B, C, and D locations, whereas for atherosclerosis significance was only seen in location D. Hypertension (as defined by the morphologic changes in the kidney) after adjusting for age, height, and weight resulted in no statistical significant effect on aortic circumference or on intimal thickness, but did show a significant increase in atherosclerosis score at locations B, C, and D. Also after adjusting for age, height, and weight, the Chinese had a significantly larger aortic circumference in location A compared with the occidental population, whereas in location D the occidentals with hypertension had a significantly larger circumference compared with Chinese, probably due to an interaction of atherosclerosis and hypertension. After similar adjustments, the medial thickness in locations A and C, the intimal thickness in B, C, and D, and atherosclerosis score in D were significantly greater in occidental than Chinese populations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {Background-- Elastic artery stiffness, a result of arterial aging, is an independent indicator of cardiovascular risk. The aim of the present longitudinal study was to compare the progression of aortic stiffness over a 6-year period in treated hypertensive subjects and normotensive subjects, and to evaluate the determinants of this progression. Methods and Results-- Data for the present analysis were gathered from 483 subjects who had 2 health checkups at the Centre d'Investigations Preventives et Cliniques, the first one in 1992-1993 and the second one in 1998-1999. Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) was used to evaluate aortic stiffness in 187 hypertensive subjects who were under treatment at the time of the first visit and throughout the follow-up period, and in 296 subjects who were classified as normotensive during the first visit and who remained treatment-free throughout the follow-up period. In both populations, PWV progression was higher in older subjects. Annual rates of progression in PWV in treated hypertensives were significantly higher than in normotensives. Only treated hypertensives with well-controlled blood pressure levels at the time of both visits had a PWV progression similar to that of normotensives. In treated hypertensives, high heart rate and high creatinine during the first visit were associated with an accelerated progression in PWV. Conclusions-- The presence of high blood pressure, high heart rate, and high serum creatinine were the major determinants of accelerated progression of aortic stiffness in treated hypertensives. This is the first longitudinal study to evaluate the determinants of arterial aging over an extended period of time.},

abstract = {Age is the main clinical determinant of large artery stiffness. Central arteries stiffen progressively with age, whereas peripheral muscular arteries change little with age. A number of clinical studies have analyzed the effects of age on aortic stiffness. Increase of central artery stiffness with age is responsible for earlier wave reflections and changes in pressure wave contours. The stiffening of aorta and other central arteries is a potential risk factor for increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Arterial stiffening with aging is accompanied by an elevation in systolic blood pressure (BP) and pulse pressure (PP). Although arterial stiffening with age is a common situation, it has now been confirmed that older subjects with increased arterial stiffness and elevated PP have higher cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.Increase in aortic stiffness with age occurs gradually and continuously, similarly for men and women. Cross-sectional studies have shown that aortic and carotid stiffness (evaluated by the pulse wave velocity) increase with age by approximately 10{\%} to 15{\%} during a period of 10 years. Women always have 5{\%} to 10{\%} lower stiffness than men of the same age.Although large artery stiffness increases with age independently of the presence of cardiovascular risk factors or other associated conditions, the extent of this increase may depend on several environmental or genetic factors. Hypertension may increase arterial stiffness, especially in older subjects. Among other cardiovascular risk factors, diabetes type 1 and 2 accelerates arterial stiffness, whereas the role of dyslipidemia and tobacco smoking is unclear. Arterial stiffness is also present in several cardiovascular and renal diseases. Patients with heart failure, end stage renal disease, and those with atherosclerotic lesions often develop central artery stiffness. Decreased carotid distensibility, increased arterial thickness, and presence of calcifications and plaques often coexist in the same subject. However, relationships between these three alterations of the arterial wall remain to be explored.},

abstract = {1. Ageing exerts a marked effect on the cardiovascular system and, in particular, the large arteries. Using a variety of techniques to assess arterial stiffness, many cross-sectional studies have demonstrated a significant relationship between age and aortic stiffness, although the age-related changes observed in peripheral arteries appear to be less marked. 2. The relationship between arterial stiffness and hypertension is more complex. The distending, or mean arterial, pressure is an important confounder of measurements of arterial stiffness and, therefore, must be taken into consideration when assessing arterial stiffness in hypertensive subjects or investigating the effect of antihypertensive agents. Current methods for correcting for differences in distending pressure involve pharmacological manipulation, statistical correction or mathematical manipulation of stiffness indices. 3. Many studies have provided evidence that both peripheral (muscular) and central (elastic) arteries are stiffer in subjects with mixed (systolic/diastolic) hypertension compared with normotensive subjects. However, it is unclear to what extent differences in mean arterial pressure explain the observed differences in hypertensive subjects. In contrast, isolated systolic hypertension is associated with increased aortic, but not peripheral artery, stiffness, although the underlying mechanisms are somewhat unclear. 4. Traditional antihypertensive agents appear to reduce arterial stiffness, but mostly via an indirect effect of lowering mean pressure. Therefore, therapies that target the large arteries to reduce stiffness directly are urgently required. Agents such as nitric oxide donors and phosphodiesterase inhibitors may be useful in reducing stiffness via functional mechanisms. In addition, inhibitors or breakers of advanced glycation end-product cross-links between proteins, such as collagen and elastin, hold substantial promise.},

abstract = {Arterial pulse wave velocity (APWV) is a measure of the elasticity (or stiffness) of peripheral arterial blood vessels. The pulse referred to here will be the pressure pulse as opposed to the flow pulse measured by ultrasound Doppler. The pressure pulse velocity varies over the range from about 12 m s(-1) to 15 m s(-1) in stiff peripheral arteries, whereas in normal arteries it has a velocity in the range of 7 to 9 m s(-1). The aim of this project was the development of a fast and easy to use system for the determination of peripheral arterial pulse wave velocity. The principle of the PWV measurement is based on simultaneous measurement of two pulse waves at two different positions, such as the radial artery at the wrist and the brachial artery just above the elbow. By determining the pulse transit time between these points and the distance measured between the two locations, pulse wave velocity may then be calculated. The pressure pulse detection is done by using two piezoelectric sensors which generate a measurable voltage at the output contacts if they are mechanically deformed. The deformation produced voltage is first amplified and filtered and then digitalized with a data acquisition card. The analysis of the data obtained from the sensors includes a filtering process, the calculation of the PWV with three different methods--foot-to-foot, cross-correlation and peak-to-peak-and the determination of the arterial pulse rate. Extensive measurements with human test subjects were carried out to optimize the techniques of data acquisition and analysis. For example, it was found that the best procedure was to hold the sensors in place using elastic straps alone. The data analysis was upgraded with an additional software module, which deletes, in effect, outriders or invalid measurements. With the optimized system, a series involving eight test subjects ranging in age from 22 to 32 years was completed (all normotensive). The arterial pulse wave velocities determined covered a range from 6 m s(-1) to 12 m s(-1), with an average standard deviation of less than 2.5 m s(-1) for individual results. These are slightly higher, but close to published APWV data. The results showed that reproducible results can be obtained with the existing PWV acquirement and analysis system.},

abstract = {Background: Arterial age can be estimated from equations relating arterial stiffness to age and blood pressure in large cohorts. We investigated whether estimated arterial age (eAA) was elevated in patients with the metabolic syndrome and/or known cardiovascular disease (CVD), which factors were associated with eAA and whether eAA added prognostic information. Methods: In 1993, 2366 study participants, 41, 51, 61, and 71 years old, had traditional cardiovascular risk factors and carotid–femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) measured. Risk groups were identified based on known CVD and components of metabolic syndrome, Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation, or Framingham risk score. From age, mean blood pressure, and cfPWV, eAA and estimated cfPWV (ePWV) were calculated. In 2006, the combined cardiovascular endpoint (CEP) of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and hospitalization for ischemic heart disease was registered. Results: cfPWV and ePWV increased with ageing and cardiovascular risk (all P {\textless} 0.001), but ePWV increased more with ageing than cfPWV. The difference between eAA and chronological age was associated with male sex (b ¼ 0.14), higher heart rate (b ¼ 0.16 both P {\textless} 0.001), fasting glucose (b ¼ 0.08) soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (b ¼ 0.06, both P {\textless} 0.01), and known CVD (b ¼ 0.06, P {\textless} 0.05) independently of age, SBP, and heart rate. Independently of Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation, eAA (hazard ratio ¼ 1.20, P {\textless} 0.01) predicted CEP, but not as accurately as ePWV (hazard ratio ¼ 1.58, P {\textless} 0.001) and cfPWV (hazard ratio ¼ 1.32, P {\textless} 0.001) among apparently healthy study participants. Conclusion: Elevated eAA was associated with male sex, higher plasma glucose, and soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor and known CVD independently of age, SBP, and heart rate.},

abstract = {This study aimed to develop a fast and effective arterial stiffness monitoring system for diabetic patients using the spring constant method and photoplethysmography (PPG). The experimental group comprised 70 patients (4 type 1 diabetes mellitus patients and 66 type 2 diabetes mellitus patients); 23 participants suffered from atherosclerosis. All were subjected to the measurements of both the carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) and the spring constants evaluated using the PPG pulse as well as the radial pulse. The control group comprised 70 normal participants (39 men and 31 women) who did not have diabetes mellitus, with an age range of 40-84 years. All control group members were only subjected to the measurement by the spring constant method. For the experimental group, statistical analysis indicated a significantly high correlation between the spring constants computed using PPG and the radial pulse (p {\textless} 0.001, correlation coefficient =0.89). The result also showed a significant negative correlation between the cfPWV and the spring constant of PPG (p {\textless} 0.001, correlation coefficient = - 0.72); multivariate analysis similarly indicated a close relationship. In addition, we used Student's t test to examine the difference between the experimental and control groups for the spring constant of PPG. A P value less than 0.05 confirmed that the difference between the two groups was statistically significant. In the receiver operating characteristic curve, area under curve (=0.82) indicates a good discrimination, and a spring constant of PPG below 516 (g/s (2)) may imply a risk of arterial stiffness for diabetic patients. These findings imply that the spring constant of PPG could effectively identify normal versus abnormal characteristics of elasticity in normal and diabetic participants. As a result of some excellent characteristics in clinical monitoring, the spring constant computed using PPG shows the effectiveness and feasibility in the monitoring system of arterial stiffness.},

abstract = {Pressure measured with a cuff and sphygmomanometer in the brachial artery is accepted as an important predictor of future cardiovascular risk. However, systolic pressure varies throughout the arterial tree, such that aortic (central) systolic pressure is actually lower than corresponding brachial values, although this difference is highly variable between individuals. Emerging evidence now suggests that central pressure is better related to future cardiovascular events than is brachial pressure. Moreover, anti-hypertensive drugs can exert differential effects on brachial and central pressure. Therefore, basing treatment decisions on central, rather than brachial pressure, is likely to have important implications for the future diagnosis and management of hypertension. Such a paradigm shift will, however, require further, direct evidence that selectively targeting central pressure, brings added benefit, over and above that already provided by brachial artery pressure.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Arterial stiffness is an important determinant of pulse pressure, and of left ventricular load and coronary perfusion pressure. ASSESSMENTS OF STIFFNESS: Precise quantification is elusive, since stiffness is different in different arteries and even in the same artery at different pressures. Proximal elastic arteries and peripheral muscular arteries respond differently to aging change and to drugs. Various other terms are used to express stiffness, such as distensibility and compliance. Various indirect indices are also used, including pulse wave velocity, characteristic impedance and augmentation index. INCREASES IN STIFFNESS: While the literature is confusing, it is well established that stiffness of central arteries increases with aging and with elevated blood pressure. Effects of other diseases and of vasoactive agents are less clear-cut.},

abstract = {We have previously shown that the decrease in large artery distensibility observed in patients with essential hypertension (HT group) was primarily due to an increase in distending pressure and not to hypertension-associated structural modifications of the artery, suggesting a functional adaptation of the wall material. To evaluate the elastic properties of the wall material of the common carotid artery, we determined Young's incremental elastic modulus (Einc) in the HT group and in normotensive subjects (NT group) as a function of blood pressure and circumferential wall stress. In 102 HT patients with never-treated essential hypertension and 40 age- and gender-matched NT subjects, the Einc-pressure and Einc-stress curves were calculated from intima-media thickness and from diameter and pressure waveforms, determined with echo tracking and aplanation tonometry, respectively. The "effective" stiffness of the wall material, determined through Einc calculated at mean blood pressure, was significantly higher in the HT than in the NT group. The "intrinsic" stiffness of the wall material, determined through Einc calculated at a common circumferential wall stress, did not differ between the 2 groups. However, when each group (HT and NT) was analyzed according to tertiles of age, the "intrinsic" stiffness of the arterial wall material was increased only in younger HT patients. In middle-aged and older HT patients, the intrinsic mechanical properties of the carotid arterial wall material were unchanged, and the increased stiffness of the common carotid artery in the HT group was due primarily to the increased level of blood pressure. These results also indicate that the deleterious effects of aging and hypertension on "intrinsic" stiffness are not additive.},

Abstract—Investigation of arterial stiffness, especially of the large arteries, has gathered pace in recent years with the development of readily available noninvasive assessment techniques. These include the measurement of pulse wave velocity, the use of ultrasound to relate the change in diameter or area of an artery to distending pressure, and analysis of arterial waveforms obtained by applanation tonometry. Here, we describe each of these techniques and their limitations and discuss how the measured parameters relate to established cardiovascular risk factors and clinical outcome. We also consider which techniques might be most appropriate for wider clinical application. Finally, the effects of current and future cardiovascular drugs on arterial stiffness are also discussed, as is the relationship between arterial elasticity and endothelial function.

abstract = {1 M uch has been published in the past 20 years on the use of measurements of arterial stiffness in animal and human research studies. This summary statement was commissioned by the American Heart Association to address issues concern-ing the nomenclature, methodologies, utility, limitations, and gaps in knowledge in this rapidly evolving field. The follow-ing represents an executive version of the larger online-only Data Supplement and is intended to give the reader a sense of why arterial stiffness is important, how it is measured, the situations in which it has been useful, its limitations, and ques-tions that remain to be addressed in this field. Throughout the document, pulse-wave velocity (PWV; measured in meters per second) and variations such as carotid-femoral PWV (cfPWV; measured in meters per second) are used. PWV without modi-fication is used in the general sense of arterial stiffness. The addition of lowercase modifiers such as " cf " is used when speaking of specific segments of the arterial circulation. The ability to measure arterial stiffness has been present for many years, but the measurement was invasive in the early times. The improvement in technologies to enable repeated, minimal-risk, reproducible measures of this aspect of circula-tory physiology led to its incorporation into longitudinal cohort studies spanning a variety of clinical populations, including those at extreme cardiovascular risk (patients on dialysis), those with comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension, healthy elders, and general populations. In the ≈3 decades of clinical use of PWV measures in humans, we have learned much about the importance of this parameter. PWV has proven to have independent predictive utility when evaluated in conjunction with standard risk factors for death and cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, the field of arterial stiffness investigation, which has exploded over the past 20 years, has proliferated without logistical guidance for clinical and translational research investigators. This summary statement, commissioned by the American Heart Association Council on Hypertension, represents an effort to provide such guidance, drawing on the expertise of experienced clinical and basic science investigators in Europe, Australia, and the United States. Recommendations made in this statement are assumed to refer to the research aspect of arterial stiffness investiga-tions, unless accompanied by language that emphasizes clini-cal use as well, and are based on the grid shown in Table 1.},

abstract = {Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV), a marker of arterial stiffness, is an established independent cardiovascular risk factor. Little information is available on the pattern and determinants of the longitudinal change in PWV with aging. Such information is crucial to elucidating mechanisms underlying arterial stiffness and the design of interventions to retard it. Between 1988 and 2013, we collected 2 to 9 serial measures of PWV in 354 men and 423 women of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, who were 21 to 94 years of age and free of clinically significant cardiovascular disease. Rates of PWV increase accelerated with advancing age in men more than women, leading to sex differences in PWV after the age of 50 years. In both sexes, not only systolic blood pressure (SBP) {\textgreater}/=140 mm Hg but also SBP of 120 to 139 mm Hg was associated with steeper rates of PWV increase compared with SBP{\textless}120 mm Hg. Furthermore, there was a dose-dependent effect of SBP in men with marked acceleration in PWV rate of increase with age at SBP {\textgreater}/=140 mm Hg compared with SBP of 120 to 139 mm Hg. Except for waist circumference in women, no other traditional cardiovascular risk factors predicted longitudinal PWV increase. In conclusion, the steeper longitudinal increase of PWV in men than women led to the sex difference that expanded with advancing age. Age and SBP are the main longitudinal determinants of PWV, and the effect of SBP on PWV trajectories exists even in the prehypertensive range},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine whether a simple index of pressure wave reflection may be derived from the digital volume pulse (DVP) and used to examine endothelium-dependent vasodilation in patients with type II diabetes mellitus. BACKGROUND: The DVP exhibits a characteristic notch or inflection point that can be expressed as percent maximal DVP amplitude (IP(DVP)). Nitrates lower IP(DVP), possibly by reducing pressure wave reflection. Response of IP(DVP) to endothelium-dependent vasodilators may provide a measure of endothelial function. METHODS: The DVP was recorded by photoplethysmography. Albuterol (salbutamol) and glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) were administered locally by brachial artery infusion or systemically. Aortic pulse wave transit time from the root of the subclavian artery to aortic bifurcation (T(Ao)) was measured by simultaneous Doppler velocimetry. RESULTS: Brachial artery infusion of drugs producing a greater than threefold increase in forearm blood flow within the infused limb was without effect on IP(DVP), whereas systemic administration of albuterol and GTN produced dose- dependent reductions in IP(DVP). The time between the first and second peak of the DVP correlated with T(Ao) (r = 0.75, n = 20, p {\textless} 0.0001). The effects of albuterol but not GTN on IP(DVP) were attenuated by N(G)-monomethyl-L- arginine. The IP(DVP) response to albuterol (400 $\mu$g by inhalation) was blunted in patients with type II diabetes mellitus as compared with control subjects (fall 5.9 ± 1.8{\%} vs. 11.8 ± 1.8{\%}, n = 20, p {\textless} 0.02), but that to GTN (500 $\mu$g sublingually) was preserved (fall 18.3 ± 1.2{\%} vs. 18.6 ± 1.9{\%}, p = 0.88). CONCLUSIONS: The IP(DVP) is influenced by pressure wave reflection. The effects of albuterol on IP(DVP) are mediated in part through the nitric oxide pathway and are impaired in patients with type II diabetes.},

Although the technique has been around for nearly 100 yr, in the past 20 to 25 yr, pragmatic noninvasive approaches have allowed the incorporation of arterial stiffness measurements, usually in the form of aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV), into clinical assessment of patients. In populations with high cardiovascular risk, especially those with ESRD, aortic PWV measurements provide predictive utility independent of the standard brachial arterial BP measurements. This review briefly discusses the history of vascular dynamics, the determinants of PWV, and some of the available technologies in current use and concludes with a section on the relevance of arterial stiffness measurements in populations of particular interest to nephrologists.},

abstract = {In this study, we propose an innovative method for the direct measurement of the peripheral artery elasticity using a spring constant model, based on the arterial pressure wave equation, vibrating in a radial direction. By means of the boundary condition of the pressure wave equation at the maximum peak, we can derive the spring constant used for evaluating peripheral arterial elasticity. The calculated spring constants of six typical subjects show a coincidence with their proper arterial elasticities. Furthermore, the comparison between the spring constant method and pulse wave velocity (PWV) was investigated in 70 subjects (21-64 years, 47 normotensives and 23 hypertensives). The results reveal a significant negative correlation for the spring constant vs. PWV (correlation coefficient = -0.663, p {\textless} 0.001). Multivariate analysis also indicates the same close relationship. Furthermore, within-operator and between-operator analyses show significantly high reproducibility. Therefore, the use of the spring constant method to assess the arterial elasticity is carefully verified, and it is shown to be effective as well as fast. This method should be useful for healthcare, not only in improving clinical diagnosis of arterial stiffness but also in screening subjects for early evidence of cardio-vascular diseases and in monitoring responses to therapy in the future.},

abstract = {We recognize that increased systolic pressure is the most challenging form of hypertension today and that pulse pressure as an independent cardiovascular risk factor has focused attention on arterial stiffness and wave reflections as the most important factors determining these pressures. In recent years, many studies emphasized the role of arterial rigidity in the development of cardiovascular diseases, and it was shown that stiffening of arteries is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. Moreover, arterial stiffening is linked to decreased glomerular filtration rate, and is predictive of kidney disease progression and the patient's cardiovascular outcome. Premature vascular aging and arterial stiffening are observed with progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and in end-stage renal disease (ESRD). This accelerated aging is associated with outward remodeling of large vessels, characterized by increased arterial radius not totally compensated for by artery wall hypertrophy. Arterial stiffening in CKD and ESRD patients is of multifactorial origin with extensive arterial calcifications representing a major covariate. With aging, the rigidity is more pronounced in the aorta than in peripheral conduit arteries, leading to the disappearance or inversion of the arterial stiffness gradient and less protection of the microcirculation from high-pressure transmission. Various non-pharmacological or pharmacological interventions can modestly slow the progression of arterial stiffness, but arterial stiffness is, in part, pressure dependent and treatments able to stop the process mainly include antihypertensive drugs.},

abstract = {The resting peripheral volume pulse wave of 44 subjects within three age categories (30-39, 40-49, 50) has been characterized using a novel algorithm for the automated determination of a mean pulse function. The contour of this resting mean pulse has been analyzed with regard to its systolic and diastolic characteristics. Previously described indices of arterial stiffness and viscoelasticity have been investigated for age-dependent variations associated with arterial mechanical properties. Measures of the minimum rise time (MRT) and the stiffness index (SI) demonstrated strong correlations with age and each other, although their derivations are unrelated. While significant correlations existed (|r| = 0.50-0.78, p {\textless} or = 0.002), pairwise comparisons between the right and left hands did not demonstrate significant differences for the minimum rise time parameter; however, the stiffness index was significantly lower in the left hand versus the right (p = 0.009). With regard to age, the youngest age group had significantly lower MRT and SI values than the two older groups. For these data, this was only demonstrated in parameters calculated for the right hand because of higher variability within age groups for the left hand. A normalized average mean pulse for each age group was determined which visually illustrated the contour changes associated with the MRT and SI parameters that occur in both the systolic and diastolic portions of the pulse. The finding that differences between the age groups were significantly more evident for the right hand suggests that the physical site for such testing may be an important consideration. This study provides further evidence regarding the merit of using contour analysis when assessing the peripheral volume pulse and the importance of establishing ageing indices for such analysis.},

abstract = {Arterial stiffness has been identified as an independent predictor of prognostic outcomes for patients with cardiovascular disease. Although measurement of pulse wave velocity has been a widely accepted noninvasive approach to the assessment of arterial stiffness, its accuracy is hampered by changes in blood pressure. Taking the exponential relation between intravascular pressure and arterial diameter into consideration, a stiffness parameter can be obtained by plotting the natural logarithm of systolic-diastolic pressure ratio against the arterial wall extensibility. Cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI), which is calculated based on the stiffness parameter thus obtained, is theoretically independent of changes in blood pressure. With this distinct advantage, CAVI has been widely applied clinically to assess arterial stiffness in subjects with known cardiovascular diseases including those with diagnosed atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, and stroke as well as those at risk, including those with hypertension, diabetes, the elderly, and the obese. Because of its enhanced sensitivity, not only has the index been used to discern subtle changes in the disease process, it has also been utilized in studying normal individuals to assess their potential risks of developing cardiovascular diseases. The primary aims of assessing arterial stiffness using CAVI are not only to aid in early detection of arteriosclerosis to allow timely treatment and change in lifestyle, but also to quantitatively evaluate the progression of disease and the effectiveness of treatment. Despite its merit of being unaffected by blood pressure, discretion in data interpretation is suggested because an elevated CAVI represents not just vascular stiffness caused by pathological changes in the arterial wall, but can also be attributed to an increased vascular tone brought about by smooth muscle contraction. Moreover, certain patient populations, such as those with an ankle-brachial index {\textless} 0.9, may give falsely low CAVI and are suggested to be excluded from study.},

We present a novel methodology to assess theoretically these computed indexes and the hemodynamics mechanisms relating them. We created a database of 3,325 virtual healthy adult subjects using a validated one-dimensional model of the arterial hemodynamics, with cardiac and arterial parameters varied within physiological healthy ranges. For each virtual subject, foot-to-foot PWV was computed from numerical pressure waveforms at the same locations where clinical measurements are commonly taken. Our numerical results confirm clinical observations: 1) carotid-femoral PWV is a good indicator of aortic stiffness and correlates well with aortic PWV; 2) brachial-ankle PWV overestimates aortic PWV and is related to the stiffness and geometry of both elastic and muscular arteries; and 3) muscular PWV (carotid-radial, femoral-ankle) does not capture the stiffening of the aorta and should therefore not be used as a surrogate for aortic stiffness. In addition, our analysis highlights that the foot-to-foot PWV algorithm is sensitive to the presence of reflected waves in late diastole, which introduce errors in the PWV estimates. In this study, we have created a database of virtual healthy subjects, which can be used to assess theoretically the efficiency of physiological indexes based on pulse wave analysis.},

abstract = {Arterial tonometry is a method to assess arterial stiffness and has become a valuable tool in the stratification of cardiovascular risk. The arterial tonometry-derived augmentation index (AIx) is a marker of arterial stiffness and an independent predictor of mortality. As the AIx is relatively cumbersome to obtain, simpler methods such as analysis of pulse waves obtained by digital photoplethysmography have been proposed to estimate arterial stiffness. The objective of this study is to compare the usefulness of the stiffness index (SI) derived from digital photoplethysmography and the AIx derived from radial tonometry for stratification of cardiovascular risk. We studied 83 subjects with a heterogeneous cardiovascular risk profile and determined the ability of the two devices to differentiate subjects with low from subjects with high cardiovascular risk estimated by the Europe (EU)-heart score. Failure rate in both devices was similar (3.6{\%}). AIx and SI were modestly correlated (r¼0.48, Po0.001) and both indexes correlated with the EU-score (r¼0.54, Po0.001) and (r¼0.56, Po0.001), respectively. Both devices discriminated accurately between subjects with high cardiovascular risk (upper tertile of the EU-score) and low cardiovascular risk (lower tertile). However, only the SI differentiated significantly between subjects with intermediate risk (middle tertile) and high risk (upper tertile). Compared with the AIx, assessment of the SI derived by digital photoplethysmography is simple and possibly yields an advantage in risk stratification of subjects with intermediate and high cardiovascular risk. Therefore, digital pulse wave analysis may be a valuable tool to estimate arterial stiffness in large clinical studies. INTRODUCTION Cardiovascular diseases are the foremost cause of death globally, and there are numerous risk factors such as diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking and obesity associated with their development and progression. 1,2 The presence of these risk factors is known to alter vessel wall properties and increase arterial stiffness leading to accelerated atherosclerosis. In the absence of clinically apparent vascular disease the detection of subclinical atherosclerosis may enable early control of cardiovascular risk factors and thus prevent the development of overt vascular disease. 3–6 Various non-invasive tech-niques measuring arterial stiffness are currently available. 7,8 Most devices derive their measures of arterial stiffness from peripherally acquired waveforms using arterial tonometry. Arterial tonometry-derived augmentation index (AIx) has been shown to be an indepen-dent predictor of mortality and cardiovascular events in patients with hypertensive, cardiovascular and renal disease. 7,9 However, measure-ments are often time consuming and a training to operate these devices is necessary. For risk assessment in large clinical trials and population-based studies it would be desirable to rely on a non-invasive technique that is user independent, rapidly performed and inexpensive. Digital photoplethysmographic assessment of the peripheral arterial pulse waveform allows pulse wave contour analysis and estimation of arterial stiffness by the stiffness index (SI). 10 However, data from large cohorts and a description of the feasibility of the technique compared with radial applanation tonometry in a heterogeneous population are lacking. Furthermore, it has not been thoroughly established, whether the SI accurately discriminates subjects with increased cardiovascular risk from subjects with no risk factors. Therefore, the purposes of this study were to evaluate (i) the feasibility and failure rate of the digital volume pulse (DVP) analysis in subjects with different degrees of cardiovascular risk (ii) the correlation between the more established AIx and the SI derived by DPV analysis and (iii) the usefulness of the SI and AIx in discriminat-ing subjects with high cardiovascular risk from subjects with low risk in a heterogeneous population of patients and healthy subjects.},

Vascular ageing is associated with changes in the mechanical and the structural properties of the vascular wall, which leads to the loss of arterial elasticity and reduced arterial compliance. Arterial compliance can be measured by different parameters like pulse wave velocity, augmentation index, and systemic arterial compliance. There is evidence that arterial compliance is reduced in disease states such as hypertension, diabetes, and end stage renal failure. Changes in arterial compliance can be present before the clinical manifestation of cardiovascular disease. Pharmacological and non-pharmacological measures have been shown to improve arterial compliance.

abstract = {Methods have been assembled permitting the simultaneous recording of intra-arterial pressure and arterial diameter with sufficient accuracy so that the mechanical properties of arteries in vivo, under physiologic conditions, can be derived. The analysis necessitates finding the relationships between 5 simultaneous variables; hence the data were recorded on magnetic tape and processed by analog and digital computer technics. Analysis of the data established the fact that the mechanical properties of arteries can be described by a linear, first-order differential equation whose coefficients can be defined as the moduli of elasticity and viscosity. Furthermore, the magnitudes of the coefficients were evaluated. The strain which the arteries undergo as a result of arterial pulse pressure variations is normally between 0.01 and 0.04, i.e., between 1 and 4 per cent change in circumference. The total strain associated with marked constriction and dilation does not usually exceed 10 per cent. Therefore, it is established that the circumferential motion of arteries may be characterized as small strain. The fact that the strain is effectively small is confirmed by analytical consideration, i.e., stress-strain relationships can be linearized under physiologic conditions without introducing significant error. The mass of the artery wall does not play a significant role in determining the mechanical behavior of the arteries and can therefore be neglected in any such considerations. The harmonic content, i.e., the frequency spectrum, comprising the pressure and diameter pulsations associated with the cardiac cycle have been evaluated by Fourier analysis. The magnitudes of the coefficients relating pressure and strain are: elastic (Ep) varies from 1,000 to 6,000 Gm./cm.2 (with the exception of a value of 500 in the thoracic aorta of a 12-week-old puppy), viscous (Rp) from 10 to 150, and mass (Mp) from 0.0002 to 0.005. The magnitudes of the coefficients vary from individual to individual, from one site to another within the vascular tree and temporally in response to vasoactive factors. The effects of epinephrine, norepinephrine, acetylcholine and autonomic nerve stimulation on the mechanical properties and behavior of arteries are discussed. The differences between the pressure-strain relationships and the wall tension-strain relationships are discussed, since the mechanical properties of the wall material itself is not given directly by the pressure-strain relationships, i.e., radius and wall thickness must be considered. An analytical discussion is developed and mathematical equations are derived which relate pressure, wall tension, radius, strain, elasticity, viscosity and inertia in a tube which has been shown to be a reliable model of the living artery. It is concluded that the concept that the arteries function as a "peripheral heart," i.e., rhythmically contract in synchrony with the heart, is not justified. Probable relationships of these properties to the structure and functions of the arterial system are discussed.},

abstract = {The arterial tree exhibits a complex spatio-temporal wave pattern, whose healthy behaviour depends on a subtle balance between mechanical and geometrical properties. Several clinical studies demonstrated that such a balance progressively breaks down during ageing, when the aorta stiffens and remodels by increasing its diameter. These two degenerative processes however, have different impacts on the arterial wave pattern. They both tend to compensate for each other, thus reducing the detrimental effect they would have had if they had arisen individually. This remarkable compensatory mechanism is investigated by a validated multi-scale model, with the aim to elucidate how aortic stiffening and remodelling quantitatively impact the complex interplay between forward and reflected backward waves in the arterial network. We focus on the aorta and on the pressure at the ventricular-aortic interface, which epidemiological studies demonstrate to play a key role in cardiovascular diseases.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: Moderate alcohol consumption has been shown to be protective for coronary heart disease, but the relationship between moderate alcohol consumption and ischemic stroke is more controversial. OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between alcohol consumption and risk of ischemic stroke. DESIGN: Population-based case-control study conducted between July 1993 and June 1997. SETTING: Multiethnic population in northern Manhattan, New York, NY, aged 40 years or older. PATIENTS AND OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Cases (n = 677) had first ischemic stroke and were matched to community controls (n = 1139) derived through random digit dialing by age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Mean +/- SD age of cases was 70.0+/-12.7 years; 55.8{\%} were women; 19.5{\%} were white, 28.4{\%} black, and 50.7{\%} Hispanic. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: First ischemic stroke (fatal or nonfatal). RESULTS: Moderate alcohol consumption, up to 2 drinks per day, was significantly protective for ischemic stroke after adjustment for cardiac disease, hypertension, diabetes, current smoking, body mass index, and education (odds ratio [OR], 0.51; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 0.39-0.67). This protective effect of alcohol consumption was detected in both younger and older groups, in men and women, and in whites, blacks, and Hispanics. In a quadratic model of stroke risk, increased risk of ischemic stroke was statistically significant among those consuming 7 or more drinks per day (OR, 2.96; 95{\%} CI, 1.05-8.29). CONCLUSIONS: Moderate alcohol consumption was independently associated with a decreased risk of ischemic stroke in our elderly, multiethnic, urban subjects, while heavy alcohol consumption had deleterious effects. Our data support the National Stroke Association Stroke Prevention Guidelines regarding the beneficial effects of moderate alcohol consumption.},

abstract = {Objectives. This study investigated the effect of age and gender on central arterial hemodynamic variables derived from noninvasive tonometric carotid pressure waveforms. Background. Women have a greater age-related increase in left ventricular (LV) mass than do men and are more likely to experience symptomatic heart failure after infarction despite their higher ejection fraction. In studies of these changes, ventricular afterload is incompletely defined by brachial blood pressure (BP) measurements. We hypothesized that there exist gender differences in pulsatile vascular load, as revealed by pressure waveform analysis, which may produce suboptimal afterload conditions in women. Methods. Data from 350 healthy normotensive subjects (187 female) aged 2 to 81 years were analyzed in decade groups. Augmentation index (AIx, the difference between early and late pressure peaks divided by pulse pressure) was used as an index of pulsatile afterload, and the ratio of diastolic to systolic pressure-time integral gave a subendocardial viability index. Heart rate, BP, ejection duration and maximal rate of pressure rise (dP/dt(max)) were also determined. Results. Male subjects had a slightly higher systolic pressure until age 50. Female subjects had higher systolic pressure augmentation after the 1st decade, a difference that was significant after age 30 (p {\textless} 0.005 for each decade). In both males and females there was a strong age dependence for AIx (r = 0.77, p {\textless} 0.001 for females, r = 0.66, p {\textless} 0.001 for males). Although males had a larger body size and higher systolic pressure, systolic pressure-time integral was similar in males and females across all age groups. Diastolic pressure-time integral was consistently lower in females because of their shorter diastolic period. Subendocardial viability index was lower in females across the entire group. Differences in stature and heart rate may contribute to these findings. Conclusions. These new data may help to explain previous findings in women of an age-related increase in LV mass and excess symptomatic heart failure that are not explained by differences in brachial BP.},

The most consistent and well-reported changes are luminal enlargement with wall thickening and a reduction of elastic properties at the level of large elastic arteries. Longstanding arterial pulsation in the central artery causes elastin fiber fatigue and fracture. Increased vascular calcification and endothelial dysfunction are also characteristic of arterial aging. These changes lead to increased pulse wave velocity, especially along central elastic arteries, and increases in systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure. Vascular aging is accelerated by coexisting cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, metabolic syndrome and diabetes. Vascular aging is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, from atherosclerosis to target organ damage, including coronary artery disease, stroke and heart failure. Various strategies, especially controlling hypertension, show benefit in preventing, delaying or attenuating vascular aging.},

abstract = {In vivo arterial stiffness is a dynamic property based on vascular function and structure. It is influenced by confounding factors like blood pressure (BP), age, gender, body mass index, heart rate, and treatment. As a consequence, standardization of the measurement conditions is imperative. General and method/device-specific user procedures are discussed. The subject's conditions should be standardized before starting measurements. These conditions include a minimal resting period of 10 min in a quiet room. It also includes prohibitions on smoking, meals, alcohol, and beverages containing caffeine before measurements. The position of the subject and time of measurements should be standardized. In comparative studies, corrections should be made for confounding factors. Repeated measurements are done preferably by the same investigator, and if available validated with user-independent automated procedures. As it is not feasible to discuss all methods or devices measuring arterial stiffness in one article, more attention is given to user procedures of commercially available devices, because these devices are of interest for a wider group of investigators. User procedures of methods/devices are discussed according to the nature of arterial stiffness measured: systemic, regional, or local arterial stiffness. Each section discusses general or method/device-specific user procedures and is followed by recommendations. Each recommendation discussed during the First International Consensus Conference on the Clinical Applications of Arterial Stiffness is quoted with the level of agreement reached during the conference.

In this paper, we present a signal quality index (SQI), which is intended to assess whether reliable heart rates (HRs) can be obtained from electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals collected using wearable sensors. The algorithms were validated on manually labeled data. Sensitivities and specificities of 94{\%} and 97{\%} were achieved for the ECG and 91{\%} and 95{\%} for the PPG. Additionally, we propose two applications of the SQI. First, we demonstrate that, by using the SQI as a trigger for a power-saving strategy, it is possible to reduce the recording time by up to 94{\%} for the ECG and 93{\%} for the PPG with only minimal loss of valid vital-sign data. Second, we demonstrate how an SQI can be used to reduce the error in the estimation of respiratory rate (RR) from the PPG.

Five thousand sixty-five UK Biobank participants underwent CMR using steady-state free precession imaging at 1.5 Tesla. Manual analysis was performed for all four cardiac chambers. Participants with non-Caucasian ethnicity, known cardiovascular disease and other conditions known to affect cardiac chamber size and function were excluded.

After applying exclusion criteria, 804 (16.2{\%}) participants were available for analysis. Left ventricular (LV) volumes were larger in males compared to females for absolute and indexed values. With advancing age, LV volumes were mostly smaller in both sexes.

However, the large number of age-increasing co-morbidities make difficult to understand the impact of cardiovascular ageing alone on the coronary flow pattern. The present study aims to shed light on the effect of arterial and ventricular ageing on the coronary circulation, which is here studied by means of a validated mathematical model. Forward and backward pressure and flow waves are analysed, as well as their intensity. Results highlight a complex spatiotemporal coronary wave pattern, where intense waves originate from the aorta (particularly in systole) and from the deep myocardium, during both the isovolumic compression and the diastolic phase. The subendocardial viability ratio decreases with age, the total coronary flow is slightly reduced, and the left-ventricular work increases. Consequently, the left-ventricular work per unit of blood flow increases, thus limiting the cell oxygen availability abundance, and therefore increasing the risk of myocardial infarction. Our results highlight a physiological age-induced supply/demand unbalance, which can augment the risk of myocardial ischemia and can contribute to pave the way to other typical coronary pathological processes},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES Acceleration plethysmograms (APGs) are obtained by taking the second derivative of photoplethysmograms (PPGs) and are noninvasive circulatory signals related to risk factors for atherosclerosis with age. There has been growing interest in the development of mobile devices to collect and analyze PPG single features for ambulatory health monitoring. The present study aimed to extract a new feature from the morphologies of APG and PPG signals to classify the dominant indices related to the pulsatile volume of blood in tissue according to age. METHODS Ten APG and 14 PPG indices were simultaneously extracted. All indices were compared via Pearson correlation coefficients (r) and a regression analysis. We introduced a combined index extracted from both the PPG and APG indices defined as the inflection point area plus the d{\_}peak (IPAD). The participants included 93 healthy adults aged 36-86 years with a mean ± standard deviation age of 57.43 ± 11.99 years. RESULTS The d{\_}peak and age index for the APG indices were significantly correlated with age (r = -0.408, p {\textless} 0.0001 and r = 0.296, p = 0.0039, respectively). Only the A1 time for PPG indices was moderately correlated with age (r = -0.247, p = 0.017). The stiffness index, including individual height information, was not related to age (r = -0.031, p = 0.7713). However, the combined IPAD index was significantly more correlated with age (r = 0.56, p {\textless} 0.001) than the other indices. CONCLUSIONS The proposed index outperformed the other 24 indices for evaluating vascular aging. We suggest that the IPAD is a significant factor related to the clinical information embedded in the PPG waveform.},

abstract = {The assessment and diagnosis of lower limb peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) is important since it can lead progressively to disabling claudication, ischaemic rest pain and gangrene. Historically, the first assessment has been palpation of the peripheral pulse since it can become damped, delayed and diminished with disease. In this study we investigated the clinical value of objective photoplethysmography (PPG) pulse measurements collected simultaneously from the right and left great toes to diagnose disease in the lower limbs. In total, 63 healthy subjects and 44 patients with suspected lower limb disease were studied. Pulse wave analysis techniques extracted timing, amplitude and shape characteristics for both toes and for right-to-left toe differences. Normative ranges of pulse characteristics were then calculated for the healthy subject group. The relative diagnostic values of the different pulse features for detecting lower limb arterial disease were determined, referenced to the established ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) measurement. The ranges of pulse characteristics and degree of bilateral similarity in healthy subjects were established, and the degrees of pulse delay, amplitude reduction, and damping and bilateral asymmetry were quantified for different grades of disease. When pulse timing, amplitude and shape features were ranked in order of diagnostic performance, the shape index (SI) gave substantial agreement with ABPI ({\textgreater}90{\%} accuracy, kappa 0.75). SI also detected higher grade disease, for legs with an ABPI less than 0.5, with a sensitivity of 100{\%}. The simple-to-calculate timing differences between pulse peaks produced a diagnostic accuracy of 88{\%} for all grades of arterial disease (kappa 0.70), and 93{\%} for higher grade disease (kappa 0.77). These contrasted with the limited discriminatory value of PPG pulse amplitude. The low-cost and simplicity of this optical-based technology could offer significant benefits to healthcare, such as in primary care where non-invasive, accurate and simple-to-use (de-skilled) diagnostic techniques are desirable.},

abstract = {A close relationship has been established between microvascular damage in brain and kidney and indices of age and hypertension (pulse pressure, aortic pulse wave velocity, and augmentation index). The mechanism of such association has not been established, nor has rationale for prevention and treatment of microvascular damage. A logical pathophysiological explanation can be offered on the basis of differential input impedance in the brain and kidney compared with other systemic vascular beds. Torrential flow and low resistance to flow in these organs exposes small arterial vessels to the high-pressure fluctuations that exist in the carotid, vertebral, and renal arteries. Such fluctuations, measurable as central pulse pressure, increase 3- to 4-fold with age. Exposure of small vessels to highly pulsatile pressure and flow explains microvascular damage and resulting renal insufficiency and intellectual deterioration, according to the mechanism established by Byrom {\textgreater}50 years ago. The logical approach to prevention and treatment requires reduction of central pulse pressure. Because the aorta and large arteries are not directly affected by drugs, this entails reduction of wave reflection by dilation of conduit arteries elsewhere in the body. This can be accomplished by regular exercise and by drugs such as nitrates, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers. The explanation given here accounts for greater and earlier vascular damage in diabetes mellitus (relative microvascular fragility) and is similar to that given for vascular changes of pulmonary hypertension caused by ventricular septal defects and other congenital vascular shunts.},

abstract = {Objectives.: Females develop cardiovascular diseases and abdominal aortic aneurysms later in life than males. In this study we investigated the diameter and compliance of the distal abdominal aorta in healthy females of varying ages. The results were compared with those obtained previously from healthy males in order to asssess potential sex-related differences in the aging process of the abdominal aorta. Methods.: An ultrasound phase-locked echo-tracking system was used to determine differences in diameter and pulsatile diameter change of the distal abdominal aorta in 69 Caucasian females from 4 to 74 years. Pressure strain elastic modulus (Ep) and stiffness ($\beta$) were calculated from diameter, pulsatile diameter change and blood pressure obtained by the auscultatory method. Compliance was defined as the inverse of Ep and $\beta$. The pressure dependence of Ep and $\beta$ was evaluated in 10 females with intraarterial blood pressure measurement at rest and during isometric exercise. Results.: The diameter of the distal abdominal aorta increased not only in the period between the ages of 5 and 25 years, but also by about 24{\%} between 25 and 70 years (p {\textless} 0.0001). From about the age of 25 years the diameter was smaller in females than in males (p {\textless} 0.01). Ep and $\beta$ increased nearly linearly with advancing age in females from 0.18 × 105 to 1.17 × 105 N/m2 (Ep) and from 1.85 to 8.51 ($\beta$). In males the increase in Ep and $\beta$ was greater and exponential in nature (p {\textless} 0.001). Ep but not $\beta$ increased significantly during blood pressure increase (p {\textless} 0.05). Stiffness ($\beta$) may therefore be a more useful index of arterial compliance than Ep. Conclusions.: This investigation demonstrates age and sex-related differences in diameter and compliance in the normal human abdominal aorta and implies that degenerative changes appear later in females than in males. {\textcopyright} 1993 Grune {\&} Stratton Ltd.},

abstract = {Introduction Proximal aorta stiffens and dilates with aging. Aortic stiffening is a well known process, carrying prognostic implications. On the contrary, few data are available about proximal aorta dilatation. It is not known if ???out of proportion??? aortic remodeling, i.e. in excess for age, sex and body size, could be a marker of early vascular ageing; there is controversy on how it would be accelerated by classical risk factors or would associate with validated markers of cardiovascular organ damage. Aim We conducted a systematic review in order to evaluate the determinants of proximal aortic dimensions, focusing on the association with arterial hypertension, cardiovascular risk factors and markers of organ damage. Determinants of proximal aorta remodeling Age, gender and body size explain 40-50{\%} of the variability of aortic dimensions; genetic predisposition accounts for nearly 20{\%}. Among cardiovascular risk factors obesity and hypertension seem to be associated with faster outward aortic remodeling. Arterial hypertension would account for a 0.60-0.78 mm greater diameter at the ascending aorta. Moreover, in hypertension, left ventricular mass showed a strict association with aortic diameter in nearly all studies. Other classical risk factors for atherogenesis such as dyslipidemia and smoking showed a weak influence on proximal aortic dimensions. No study reported a greater aortic remodeling in diabetics. Conclusions ???Out of proportion??? proximal aortic remodeling, could represent a subclinical marker of early vascular ageing, describing the cumulative influence of genetic predisposition, arterial hypertension and obesity.},

abstract = {AIMS Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV), a direct measure of aortic stiffness, has become increasingly important for total cardiovascular (CV) risk estimation. Its application as a routine tool for clinical patient evaluation has been hampered by the absence of reference values. The aim of the present study is to establish reference and normal values for PWV based on a large European population. METHODS AND RESULTS We gathered data from 16 867 subjects and patients from 13 different centres across eight European countries, in which PWV and basic clinical parameters were measured. Of these, 11 092 individuals were free from overt CV disease, non-diabetic and untreated by either anti-hypertensive or lipid-lowering drugs and constituted the reference value population, of which the subset with optimal/normal blood pressures (BPs) (n = 1455) is the normal value population. Prior to data pooling, PWV values were converted to a common standard using established conversion formulae. Subjects were categorized by age decade and further subdivided according to BP categories. Pulse wave velocity increased with age and BP category; the increase with age being more pronounced for higher BP categories and the increase with BP being more important for older subjects. The distribution of PWV with age and BP category is described and reference values for PWV are established. Normal values are proposed based on the PWV values observed in the non-hypertensive subpopulation who had no additional CV risk factors. CONCLUSION The present study is the first to establish reference and normal values for PWV, combining a sizeable European population after standardizing results for different methods of PWV measurement.},

abstract = {Hypertension is a condition of persistently elevated blood pressure, associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Non-invasive BP measurement using Korotkoff sounds is the most common method of screening for the condition. The possibility of inaccurate readings leading to a false diagnosis of hypertension (pseudo-hypertension) is of concern. Stiffened arteries in the elderly have been proposed as being the primary cause of pseudo-hypertension. Non-invasive detection of pseudo-hypertension remains problematic. This paper reviews clinical literature on pseudo hypertension and approaches to measuring the compressive stiffness of arteries, as well as biomechanical literature regarding models of arterial stiffness and the origin of Korotkoff sounds. Models of the latter show the importance of the relationship between transmural pressure and cross-sectional area (P1/Csa curve) of the brachial artery as it closes under the influence of the pressure cuff. The review concludes that future research on pseudo-hypertension should include development of new instrumentation to measure the P1/Csa curve of the brachial artery in vivo using non-invasive techniques suitable for application to an elderly population.},

abstract = {While determinants of aortic pulse wave velocity (aPWV) are well known, much less is known about factors affecting lower-extremity pulse wave velocity (lePWV). Unlike aPWV, increased lePWV does not predict cardiovascular risk, but limits lower-extremity blood flow and is associated with increased left ventricular mass. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of cardiovascular risk factors on aPWV and lePWV. A total of 911 individuals from the Czech post-MONICA study (a randomly selected 1{\%} representative population sample, mean age 54±13.5 years, 47{\%} men) were examined. Pulse wave velocity was measured using the SphygmoCor device. Aging had a large effect on aPWV, but only a small effect on lePWV. After adjustment for covariates, we observed that hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease and dyslipidemia were positively and significantly associated with aPWV. However, only hypertension had a significant effect on lePWV. Increased ankle systolic blood pressure was associated with increased aPWV independently of brachial blood pressure. Ankle systolic blood pressure was more closely related to aPWV than lePWV. Subjects with an ankle-brachial index {\textless}1.0 had higher aPWV and lower lePWV compared with individuals with a normal ankle-brachial index. Lower-extremity arterial stiffness is affected by age and cardiovascular risk factors to a lesser extent than aortic stiffness. Increased ankle systolic blood pressure is linked not only to increased lower-extremity arterial stiffness, but also increased aortic stiffness. In subjects with a low ankle-brachial index, lower-extremity arterial stiffness is spuriously decreased.},

Normal pulse wave velocity values for the pediatric population derived from a large data collection have yet to be available. The aim of this study was to create a reference database and to characterize the factors determining pulse wave velocity in children and teenagers. Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity was measured by applanation tonometry. Reference tables from pulse wave velocities obtained in 1008 healthy subjects (aged between 6 and 20 years; 495 males) were generated using a maximum-likelihood curve-fitting technique for calculating SD scores in accordance with the skewed distribution of the raw data. Effects of sex, age, height, weight, blood pressure, and heart rate on pulse wave velocity were assessed. Sex-specific reference tables and curves for age and height are presented. Pulse wave velocity correlated positively (PϽ0.001) with age, height, weight, and blood pressure while correlating negatively with heart rate. After multiple regression analysis, age, height, and blood pressure remained major predictors of pulse wave velocity. This study, involving Ͼ1000 children, is the first to provide reference values for pulse wave velocity in children and teenagers, thereby constituting a suitable tool for longitudinal clinical studies assessing subgroups of children who are at long-term risk of cardiovascular disease.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Observational studies indicate that moderate levels of alcohol consumption may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. In addition to providing an updated summary of the existing literature, this meta-analysis explored whether reductions in risk may be the product of misclassification bias.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A systematic search was undertaken, identifying studies that reported a temporal association between alcohol consumption and the risk of type 2 diabetes. No restrictions were placed upon the language or date of publication. Non-English publications were, where necessary, translated using online translation tools. Models were constructed using fractional polynomial regression to determine the best-fitting dose-response relationship between alcohol intake and type 2 diabetes, with a priori testing of sex and referent group interactions.RESULTS Thirty-eight studies met the selection criteria, representing 1,902,605 participants and 125,926 cases of type 2 diabetes. A conventional noncurrent drinking category was reported by 33 studies, while five reported a never-drinking category. Relative to combined abstainers, reductions in the risk of type 2 diabetes were present at all levels of alcohol intake {\textless}63 g/day, with risks increasing above this threshold. Peak risk reduction was present between 10–14 g/day at an 18{\%} decrease in hazards. Stratification of available data revealed that reductions in risk may be specific to women only and absent in studies that adopted a never-drinking abstention category or sampled an Asian population region.CONCLUSIONS Reductions in risk among moderate alcohol drinkers may be confined to women and non-Asian populations. Although based on a minority of studies, there is also the possibility that reductions in risk may have been overestimated by studies using a referent group contaminated by less healthy former drinkers.},

abstract = {Pulse wave velocity (PWV) is a useful method to assess arterial stiffness and predict mortality of atherosclerosis-related diseases. The progression of atherosclerosis is not homogeneous. There must be difference of PWV between sites by site. Therefore we designed a multi-channel instrument to measure PWV at different sites of the body simultaneously. We measured PWV at six different regions simultaneously. Thirty four healthy adults received the measurement. We found that PWVs were higher in the large vessels, by measuring from the heart to toes and heart to fingers as compared with the measurement from the heart to the earlobes (4.76 ± 0.46 m/s; 4.67 ± 0.41 m/s; 1.10 ± 0.16 m/s). The PWV of the left and right sides were the same. Although there were statistically significances, the correlation of PWV between foot and hand is better than those between ear and foot and between ear and hand. Herein we presented a novel and reliable measurement of PWV. The changes of PWV in different regions may be used in predicting disease processes such as stroke, coronary artery diseases and renal diseases, respectively.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Pulse wave velocity (PWV) and augmentation index (AIx) are parameters of arterial stiffness and wave reflection. PWV and AIx are strong indicators for cardiovascular risk and are used increasingly in clinical practice. Previous systems for assessment of PWV and AIx are investigator dependent and time consuming. The aim of this study was to validate the new oscillometric method (Arteriograph) for determining PWV and AIx by comparing it to two clinically validated, broadly accepted tonometric and piezo-electronic systems (SphygmoCor and Complior). DESIGN AND METHOD: PWV and AIx were measured up to five times in 51 patients with the SphygmoCor, Complior and Arteriograph. In 35 patients, the measurements were repeated after 1 week in a second session using the same protocol. RESULTS: The correlations of the PWV as assessed with the Arteriograph with the values obtained using the SphygmoCor (r = 0.67, P {\textless} 0.001) and the Complior (r = 0.69, P {\textless} 0.001) were highly significant. Variability and reproducibility for PWV were best for the Arteriograph, followed by Complior and SphygmoCor. AIx (SphygmoCor versus Arteriograph) were very closely correlated (r = 0.92, P {\textless} 0.001). PERSPECTIVES: The Arteriograph is a new, easy-to-use and time-effective method for assessing arterial stiffness and wave reflection.},

We have used a structured tree attached to the terminal branches of the truncated arterial tree in which the root impedance is estimated using a semianalytical approach based on a linearization of the viscous axisymmetric Navier-Stokes equations. This provides a dynamic boundary condition that maintains the phase lag between blood flow and pressure as well as the high-frequency oscillations present in the impedance spectra. Furthermore, it accommodates the wave propagation effects for the entire systemic arterial tree. The result is a model that is physiologically adequate as well as computationally feasible.

abstract = {Stiffening of the small artery may be the earliest sign of arteriosclerosis. However, there is no adequate method for directly assessing small arterial stiffness. In this study, the finger arterial elasticity index (FEI) was defined as the parameter n which denotes the curvilinearity of an exponential model of pressure (P)-volume (V(a)) relationship (V(a) = a - b exp (-nP)). For the original estimation, the FEI was calculated from a compliance index from the finger photoplethysmogram whilst occluding the finger. A simple estimation of the FEI was devised by utilizing normalized pulse volume instead of the compliance index. Both estimations yielded close agreement with the exponential model in healthy young participants (study 1: n = 19). Since the FEI was dependent on finger mean blood pressure, normalized finger arterial stiffness index (FSI) was defined as standardized residual from their relationship: mean and standard deviation (SD) of the FSI were 50 ± 10 (study 2: n = 174). The mean coefficient of variation of the FSI for four measurements was 5.72{\%} (study 3: n = 6). The mean and SD of the FSI in seven arteriosclerotic patients were 100.0 ± 13.5. In conclusion, the FEI and FSI by simple estimation are valid and useful for arteriosclerosis research.},

The distensibility was assessed from the relative increase in arterial diameter during systole normalized with respect to the arterial pulse pressure. The cross-sectional compliance was obtained by multiplying the distensibility by the arterial diameter. The relative diameter changes of the common carotid artery during the cardiac cycle were recorded on-line with a high resolution multigate pulsed Doppler system. The arterial diameter was assessed from the width of the velocity profiles which can also be recorded on-line with this system. Arterial pulse pressure was determined from brachial artery cuff blood pressure measurements. Both distensibility and cross-sectional compliance of the common carotid artery decreased linearly with age, starting in the third age decade. The reduction in the latter parameter was less pronounced, probably as a consequence of an increase in arterial diameter with age.},

On the other hand, the incremental elastic modulus was utilized as a parameter which represents the intrinsic elastic properties of wall material itself. It was found that the intracranial arteries below middle age are significantly stiff, and have higher incremental elastic moduli and wall stresses compared with the extracranial arteries. The elastic properties as well as wall dimensions of intracranial and extracranial arteries showed different trends with age.

abstract = {Background-Various measures of arterial stiffness and wave reflection have been proposed as cardiovascular risk markers. Prior studies have not assessed relations of a comprehensive panel of stiffness measures to prognosis in the community. Methods and Results-We used proportional hazards models to analyze first-onset major cardiovascular disease events (myocardial infarction, unstable angina, heart failure, or stroke) in relation to arterial stiffness (pulse wave velocity [PWV]), wave reflection (augmentation index, carotid-brachial pressure amplification), and central pulse pressure in 2232 participants (mean age, 63 years; 58{\%} women) in the Framingham Heart Study. During median follow-up of 7.8 (range, 0.2 to 8.9) years, 151 of 2232 participants (6.8{\%}) experienced an event. In multivariable models adjusted for age, sex, systolic blood pressure, use of antihypertensive therapy, total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations, smoking, and presence of diabetes mellitus, higher aortic PWV was associated with a 48{\%} increase in cardiovascular disease risk (95{\%} confidence interval, 1.16 to 1.91 per SD; P = 0.002). After PWV was added to a standard risk factor model, integrated discrimination improvement was 0.7{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval, 0.05{\%} to 1.3{\%}; P{\textless}0.05). In contrast, augmentation index, central pulse pressure, and pulse pressure amplification were not related to cardiovascular disease outcomes in multivariable models. Conclusions-Higher aortic stiffness assessed by PWV is associated with increased risk for a first cardiovascular event. Aortic PWV improves risk prediction when added to standard risk factors and may represent a valuable biomarker of cardiovascular disease risk in the community. (Circulation. 2010;121:505-511.)},

abstract = {A distributed model of the human arterial tree including all main systemic arteries coupled to a heart model is developed. The one-dimensional (1-D) form of the momentum and continuity equations is solved numerically to obtain pressures and flows throughout the systemic arterial tree. Intimal shear is modeled using the Witzig-Womersley theory. A nonlinear viscoelastic constitutive law for the arterial wall is considered. The left ventricle is modeled using the varying elastance model. Distal vessels are terminated with three-element windkessels. Coronaries are modeled assuming a systolic flow impediment proportional to ventricular varying elastance. Arterial dimensions were taken from previous 1-D models and were extended to include a detailed description of cerebral vasculature. Elastic properties were taken from the literature. To validate model predictions, noninvasive measurements of pressure and flow were performed in young volunteers. Flow in large arteries was measured with MRI, cerebral flow with ultrasound Doppler, and pressure with tonometry. The resulting 1-D model is the most complete, because it encompasses all major segments of the arterial tree, accounts for ventricular-vascular interaction, and includes an improved description of shear stress and wall viscoelasticity. Model predictions at different arterial locations compared well with measured flow and pressure waves at the same anatomical points, reflecting the agreement in the general characteristics of the "generic 1-D model" and the "average subject" of our volunteer population. The study constitutes a first validation of the complete 1-D model using human pressure and flow data and supports the applicability of the 1-D model in the human circulation.},

abstract = {Large artery stiffness, as measured by pulse wave velocity, is correlated with high blood pressure and may be a causative factor in essential hypertension. The extracellular matrix components, specifically the mix of elastin and collagen in the vessel wall, determine the passive mechanical properties of the large arteries. Elastin is organized into elastic fibers in the wall during arterial development in a complex process that requires spatial and temporal coordination of numerous proteins. The elastic fibers last the lifetime of the organism but are subject to proteolytic degradation and chemical alterations that change their mechanical properties. This review discusses how alterations in the amount, assembly, organization, or chemical properties of the elastic fibers affect arterial stiffness and blood pressure. Strategies for encouraging or reversing alterations to the elastic fibers are addressed. Methods for determining the efficacy of these strategies, by measuring elastin amounts and arterial stiffness, are summarized. Therapies that have a direct effect on arterial stiffness through alterations to the elastic fibers in the wall may be an effective treatment for essential hypertension.},

abstract = {Aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV), a measure of aortic stiffness, is an important indicator of cardiovascular risk. Derivation of PWV from uncalibrated proximal aortic or carotid pressure alone has practical advantages. However, when the time of return of the reflected wave, (Delta)t, is used to calculate PWV, inaccurate data are obtained. With aging PWV increases but (Delta)t hardly decreases, suggesting that the reflection site moves toward the periphery. We hypothesized that the forward and reflected waves in the distal aorta are not in phase, leading to an undefined reflection site. We derived forward and backward waves, at the entrance and distal end of a uniform tube, with length "L." With the tube closed at the end, forward and reflected waves are there in phase, and PWV=2L/(Delta)t. When the tube is ended with the input impedance of the lower body, forward and backward waves at its end are not in phase, and (Delta)t is increased, suggesting that the reflection site is further away (tube seems longer), and PWV calculated from 2L/(Delta)t is underestimated. Using an anatomically accurate model of the human arterial system, we show that the forward and backward waves in the distal aorta are not in phase. When aortic PWV increases, (Delta)t changes only little, and the reflection site appears to move to the periphery, similar to what is observed in humans. We conclude that to define the location of a reflection site is elusive and that PWV cannot be calculated from time of return of the reflected wave.},

The central arterial pressure wave is composed of a forward traveling wave generated by left ventricular ejection and a later arriving reflected wave from the periphery. Increased stiffness of elastic arteries is the primary cause of increased pulse pressure in subjects with degeneration and hyperplasia of the arterial wall. As stiffness increases, transmission velocity of both forward and reflected waves increase, which causes the reflected wave to arrive earlier in the central aorta and augments pressure in late systole [ie, augmentation index = (augmented pressure/pulse pressure) increases]. These changes in wave reflection properties are associated with vascular disease and aging and cause an increase in left ventricular afterload, myocardial mass, and oxygen consumption. Vasoactive drugs have little direct effect on large elastic arteries but can markedly change wave reflection amplitude and augmentation index by altering stiffness of the muscular arteries and modifying transmission velocity of the reflected wave from the periphery to the heart. This change in amplitude and timing of the reflected wave causes a generalized change in central arterial systolic and pulse pressure that is not detected by cuff pressure measurements in the brachial artery.},

abstract = {In the search for better predictors of cardiovascular events, pulse wave velocity (PWV) has gained considerable interest. We compared three single-location methods to locally estimate PWV based on simultaneous measurements of pressure (P), velocity (U) or arterial diameter (D): the PU, ln(D)U and QA-method. First, the performance of these methods was analyzed using 3D fluid-structure interaction simulations (FSI) in a tube and patient-specific carotid artery. We demonstrated that the outcome was dependent on whether the methods were tested in the ideal conditions of a 3D axisymmetrical and reflection-free tube or in the more realistic setup of a carotid artery. The three single-location PWV methods performed similarly in the tube (4.29 m/s for PU, 4.44 m/s for ln(D)U and 4.38 m/s for QA) while the carotid data showed that the PU-method dramatically overestimates PWV (9.16 m/s), and the ln(D)U and QA-method underestimate (3.86 and 3.84 m/s, respectively). The erroneously high wavespeeds from the PU-method were attributed to wave reflections, which was confirmed by measurements in 37 healthy adults. This in vivo study showed similar discrepancies between the 3 single-location techniques as present in the carotid simulations, with the difference between the PU- and ln(D)U-method related to the magnitude of wave reflection.},

abstract = {The pulse wave velocity (PWV) and the photoplethysmogram (PTG) are noninvasive methods for evaluating the pulse wave. The PWV has been associated with age and arterial hypertension, and an index of the second derivative of PTG (SDPTG) is correlated with age and other risk factors for atherosclerosis. The aim of this study was to compare SDPTG and PWV concerning the influencing factors of vascular compliance, including age and atherosclerosis, in a large hypertensive population. We studied consecutively 524 essential hypertensives, 140 with atherosclerotic alterations (AA), defined on the basis of clinical events including coronary heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, stroke, and abdominal aorta aneurysm. The PWV carotid-femoral was measured by a Complior device and the SDPTG was recorded by Fukuda FCP-3166. The augmentation index (AUI) of PTG was defined as the ratio of the late systolic peak to that of the early systolic peak in the pulse. The SDPTG consists of an a,b,c, and d wave in systole and an e wave in diastole; an SDPTG aging index (AI) was calculated as (b-c-d-e)/a. The patients with AA presented a higher PWV (14.9 +/- 4 m/sec v 12.4 +/- 2 m/sec, P {\textless} .001), PTG AUI (0.322 +/- 0.16 v 0.252 +/-0.09, P {\textless} .001), and SDPTG AI (-0.093 +/- 0.03 v -0.271 +/- 0.018, P {\textless} .001). However, in patients 60 years of age, only PWV remained higher in those with AA, whereas in patients {\textgreater}60 yr, both PWV and SDPTG AI remained higher in those with AA. The PWV was independently influenced by age, systolic blood pressure, glucose, AA, and plasma creatinine, whereas the PTG AUI was influenced by age and systolic pressure and the SDPTG AI by age and AA. In a logistic regression model for the presence of AA, including age, plasma creatinine, smoking, and diastolic BP, PWV was a significant independent determinant of AA, whereas SDPTG-AI weakly entered into the model. This study provides evidence that the aortic PWV reflects better than the SDPTG the modifications of the arterial compliance related to age, blood pressure, and atherosclerosis. However, the SDPTG AI may be useful for evaluation of vascular aging in hypertensives.},

abstract = {Although the flow-mediated dilation (FMD) index is considered the most reliable indicator of vascular endothelial function, previous studies have proved that the dilatation index (DI) measured by the highly reproducible air pressure sensing system (APSS) is just as accurate in effectively determining endothelial function. Besides, not only is APSS cheaper than the instrument for FMD ratio measurement, but operation of the former is also simple to facilitate its domestic use. However, APSS had the pitfall of being time-consuming because of the large amount of computation involved. This study attempted to validate a new self-developed endothelial function screening (EFS) device that utilized the photoplethysmography (PPG) system for acquiring PPG waveform signals from the index finger through an infrared sensor and a pressure cuff for applying pressure on ipsilateral upper arm for eliciting reactive hyperemic response to assess vascular health. The mean peak amplitude of the signals during the hyperemic phase was divided by that of the baseline to produce an EFS ratio. Fifty-two volunteers of age 34.76 +/- 15.23 years without history of cardiovascular diseases were recruited for vascular endothelial function evaluation using the EFS device and the APSS. Bland-Altman analysis showed good consistency between the EFS ratio and DI. Besides, linear regression analysis demonstrated highly significant correlation between the two sets of data (p {\textless} 0.001, r2 = 0.6261) In conclusion, the present study, which attempted to validate a self-developed, economical, and time-efficient device that can be operated in a domestic setting, demonstrated that the EFS device yielded consistent results on vascular endothelial function comparable to those acquired through APSS.},

@article{Craiem2010,
abstract = {The ambulatory arterial stiffness index (AASI) is claimed to be a new estimator for arterial rigidity. It was recently defined as one minus the slope of the linear regression of systolic to diastolic ambulatory pressure during 24 h. Although several reports testify its clinical relevance, the explanation of how this new index is conceptually associated with arterial stiffness remains controversial. In this work we hypothesize that nonlinear arterial elasticity is behind AASI physiological principles. To that end, random number generators were used to emulate arterial cross-sectional area (CSA) during 24 h. Pressure values were calculated using linear and nonlinear elasticity models for rigid and compliant arteries. The AASI was calculated from simulated pressures and also analytically predicted for each model. Additionally, invasive aortic pressure and CSA were continuously measured in a conscious sheep during 24 h to test the nonlinear model. We found that analytical solutions agreed with simulation outcomes; for the nonlinear model, the AASI was higher in rigid arteries with respect to compliant arteries (0.51 versus 0.38) and the linear model systematically predicted AASI = 0. For in vivo pressure measurements, AASI was 0.31. Using the measured pulsatile CSA and an estimation of the elastic constant for the nonlinear model, the AASI was accurately predicted with errors below 5{\%}. We conclude that the AASI is higher in stiffer arteries due to the nonlinear behavior of the arterial wall. With a nonlinear arterial function, the slope of the linear regression of diastolic to systolic pressures during 24 h depends on the product of an elastic constant by the pulsatile CSA. As the elastic constant dominates the product, the reported associations between the AASI and arterial stiffness indices now have a consistent explanation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A reduction in compliance of the large-sized cardiothoracic (central) arteries is an independent risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease with advancing age. METHODS AND RESULTS: We determined the role of habitual exercise on the age-related decrease in central arterial compliance by using both cross-sectional and interventional approaches. First, we studied 151 healthy men aged 18 to 77 years: 54 were sedentary, 45 were recreationally active, and 53 were endurance exercise-trained. Central arterial compliance (simultaneous B-mode ultrasound and arterial applanation tonometry on the common carotid artery) was lower (P:{\textless}0.05) in middle-aged and older men than in young men in all 3 groups. There were no significant differences between sedentary and recreationally active men at any age. However, arterial compliance in the endurance-trained middle-aged and older men was 20{\%} to 35{\%} higher than in the 2 less active groups (P:{\textless}0.01). As such, age-related differences in central arterial compliance were smaller in the endurance-trained men than in the sedentary and recreationally active men. Second, we studied 20 middle-aged and older (53+/-2 years) sedentary healthy men before and after a 3-month aerobic exercise intervention (primarily walking). Regular exercise increased central arterial compliance (P:{\textless}0.01) to levels similar to those of the middle-aged and older endurance-trained men. These effects were independent of changes in body mass, adiposity, arterial blood pressure, or maximal oxygen consumption. CONCLUSIONS: Regular aerobic-endurance exercise attenuates age-related reductions in central arterial compliance and restores levels in previously sedentary healthy middle-aged and older men. This may be one mechanism by which habitual exercise lowers the risk of cardiovascular disease in this population.},

abstract = {Objectives The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of age on regional aortic pulse wave velocity (aPWV). Background aPWV is an independent predictor of cardiovascular risk and increases exponentially with age. However, it is unclear whether such changes occur uniformly along the length of the aorta or vary by region. Methods A total of 162 subjects, aged 18 to 77 years and free of cardiovascular disease and medication, were recruited from the Anglo-Cardiff Collaborative Trial. Cine phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging was performed at 5 aortic levels. Systolic diameter and average blood flow were measured at each level and regional aPWV (regional aPWV measured by cine phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging) determined in 4 aortic segments: the arch (R1), the thoracic-descending aorta (R2), mid-descending aorta (R3), and the abdominal aorta (R4) and across the entire aorta. Results Regional PWV measured by cine phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging values increased from the valve to the bifurcation in the 4 segments (PWV-R1- PWV-R4: 4.6 ± 1.5 m/s, 5.5 ± 2.0 m/s, 5.7 ± 2.3 m/s, 6.1 ± 2.9 m/s, respectively) and did not differ between genders. The greatest age-related difference in stiffness occurred in the abdominal aorta (+0.9 m/s per decade, p {\textless} 0.001) followed by the thoracic-descending region (+0.7 m/s, p {\textless} 0.001), the mid-descending region (+0.6 m/s, p {\textless} 0.001) and aortic arch (+0.4 m/s, p {\textless} 0.001). The average systolic diameters decreased moving distally (L1-5: 3.1 ± 0.4 cm, 2.3 ± 0.3 cm, 2.1 ± 0.3 cm, 1.9 ± 0.2 cm, and 1.7 ± 0.2 cm, respectively). The greatest variation in systolic diameter as a function of age occurred in the ascending region (+0.96 mm/decade, p {\textless} 0.001). Values of aPWV measured across the entire aorta were strongly correlated with PWV-tonometry (R = 0.71, p {\textless} 0.001), although they were significantly lower (mean difference 1.7 ± 1.6 m/s, p {\textless} 0.001). Conclusions The greatest difference in aortic stiffness occurs in the abdominal region, whereas the greatest difference in diameter occurs in the ascending aorta, which may help offset an increase in wall stiffness. {\textcopyright} 2010 American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

                        DVP and comorbidity. Methods: Photoplethysmography was performed on the index finger of the dominant hand or the hand from the nonfistula arm in 49 renal transplant (TX) recipients and 48 hemodialysis (HD) patients. Pulse curves were analyzed with computer assistance. Comorbidity was assessed by using an established index. Results: The intrasubject variability of SI
                        DVP was 5.7{\%}. SI
                        DVP and aortic PWV values correlated significantly (r = 0.66; P = 0.001) in patients with ESRD. SI
                        DVP could not be assessed reliably in 25{\%} and 6{\%} of HD patients and TX recipients, respectively. Multivariate regression analyses showed that SI

Methods and results: In 809 individuals from the Czech post-MONICA study (aged 54??13.5 years, 47{\%} men), we compared the association of carotid-femoral PWV (cfPWV), carotid-ankle PWV (caPWV), and BETA with cardiovascular risk factors, parameters of subclinical organ damage, and presence of manifest cardiovascular disease.Both cfPWV and caPWV were similarly associated with blood pressure and glucose level, while cfPWV was more strongly associated with age, cholesterol level and glomerular filtration rate whereas caPWV with Sokolow-Lyon index. BETA derived from cfPWV and caPWV was less dependent on blood pressure, while it showed a closer association with coronary heart disease presence, as compared to cfPWV and caPWV. Conclusions: Addition of lower extremity to aortic stiffness has an effect on the association with cardiovascular risk factors while having no effect on the association with manifest cardiovascular disease. Beta transformation of PWV decreases its dependence on blood pressure and may increase its power in cardiovascular risk prediction. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {Analysis of the contour of the blood volume pulse (VP) has become important because it contains much information about cardiovascular activity. Traditionally, pulse contour analysis requires first or higher derivatives to be calculated. This paper describes a novel algorithm for analysing simultaneously measured ear and finger photoplethysmography (PPG) signals. The algorithm separates the systolic wave and the diastolic wave of the VP and fits each of them with the sum of two Gaussian functions. The VP was obtained from PPG signals taken from 40 healthy subjects at each heartbeat cycle. From the evaluated VP, time values of the direct wave and three reflected waves were calculated, as well as the augmentation index (AI) and the reflection index (RI). The evaluated parameters were compared with those that were obtained by the derivative method, and it was demonstrated that the new method can be used to analyze VP waveforms.},

We compared the relationship between AIx and age, height and sex with 'gold standard' measures of wave reflection derived from measurements of pressure and flow to establish how well AIx measures wave reflection.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Measurements of carotid pressure and flow velocity were made in the carotid artery of 65 healthy normotensive individuals (age 21-78 yr; 43 male) and pulse wave analysis, wave intensity analysis and wave separation was performed; waveforms were classified into type A, B or C. AIx, the time of the first shoulder (T(s)), wave reflection index (WRI) and the ratio of backward to forward pressure (P(b)/P(f)) were calculated.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: AIx did not correlate with log WRI or P(b)/P(f). When AIx was restricted to positive values AIx and log WRI were positively correlated (r = 0.33; p = 0.04). In contrast log WRI and P(b)/P(f) were closely correlated (r = 0.66; p{\textless}0.001). There was no correlation between the T(s) and the timing of Pb or the reflected wave identified by wave intensity analysis. Wave intensity analysis showed that the morphology of type C waveforms (negative AIx) was principally due to a forward travelling (re-reflected) decompression wave in mid-systole. AIx correlated positively with age, inversely with height and was higher in women. In contrast log WRI and P(b)/P(f) showed negative associations with age, were unrelated to height and did not differ significantly by gender.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: AIx has serious limitations as a measure of wave reflection. Negative AIx values derived from Type C waves should not be used as estimates of wave reflection magnitude.},

How an increase in HR may influence the PP level has never been investigated. In 11 patients with pacemaker monitoring, aortic (pulse-wave analysis) and digital (photoplethysmographic device) blood pressure were measured at 3 different levels of HR, together with determinations of carotid dimensions (echo tracking technique), wave reflections (pulse-wave analysis), and aortic pulse-wave velocity. Increased HR is associated with the following: (1) a significant increase of digital systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressure; (2) a significant reduction of digital and carotid PP, with a more pronounced reduction of the carotid than of the digital PP, resulting in a significant PP amplification; and (3) a reduction in the time required for the backward pressure wave to return toward the heart, without any change of arterial stiffness. Increased HR significantly enhances PP amplification, leading to an increase of peripheral blood pressure without comparable change in central blood pressure. These results are important to consider for a better understanding of cardiovascular risk and the mechanism of white-coat hypertension.},

abstract = {Compliance and distensibility are wall properties of large arteries, which may play a role in cardiovascular disease. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the influence of age on these vessel wall properties differs between vascular territories and is gender-dependent. In a population sample of 498 men and women 20 to 79 years of age, diameter, distensibility, and compliance coefficient of the muscular brachial artery were measured with an echo-tracking device. Distensibility of the aorta was measured with the use of pulse-wave velocity. The effects of age and gender were assessed and adjusted for confounding factors such as mean blood pressure, pulse rate, body mass index, smoking, alcohol intake, and antihypertensive treatment. Covariance analysis showed no relation between gender and distensibility of the elastic aorta. Distensibility of the muscular brachial artery was lower in men, whereas men had a larger diameter and larger compliance of the brachial artery. With age, distensibility of the aorta decreased in both sexes to the same extent, whereas distensibility of the brachial artery did not change significantly. With age, brachial artery diameter increased; this increase was more pronounced in women. In men brachial artery compliance did not change with age, whereas in women compliance of the brachial artery increased with age. This study (1) confirms that distensibility of the aorta, an elastic artery, decreases with age. (2) In contrast to the aorta, after adjustment for confounding factors, in both men and women, no relation exists between age and distensibility of the muscular brachial artery. (3) Brachial artery diameter increase with age is more pronounced in women than in men. (4) In contrast to the well-known decrease in arterial compliance of elastic arteries with age, brachial artery compliance is not decreased with age and is increased in women. In conclusion, the effect of age on large-artery wall properties is not uniform but depends on gender and vascular territory.},

abstract = {Arterial stiffness is increasingly recognized as an important prognostic index and potential therapeutic target in patients with hypertension. It is closely linked to, but by no means synonymous with, raised blood pressure, and its physiopathology is still not fully understood. Aortic stiffness and arterial pulse wave reflections are key determinants of elevated central systolic pressure and are associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes, independent of blood pressure. Indeed, the 2003 European Society of Hypertension guidelines on the management of hypertension acknowledge the potential role of arterial stiffness measurement in clinical management1 and have prompted the publication of  a consensus document on the measurement of central blood pressure  and hemodynamics.2 A detailed expert consensus document has also been published on the methodologic and clinical issues around arterial stiffness.3 Broader implementation of these techniques into routine care seems inevitable. In this review, we have examined recent research in this field published in Hypertension, focusing on mechanistic work, methods for measuring stiffness, important clinical associations, and effects of treatment.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMechanisms and Causes of Arterial Stiffness$\backslash$nHypertension and arterial stiffness are closely associated with age.4 Degeneration of compliant elastin fibers, and deposition of stiffer collagen, is considered a key cause of age-related arterial stiffening. Moreover, blood pressure plays a significant role in determining vessel wall structure, with remodeling occurring to compensate for changes in wall stress. One potential mechanism is through matrix metalloproteinases, which modulate extracellular matrix proteins. When angiotensin II is given to mice, matrix metalloproteinase 9 activity is induced, resulting in enhanced collagen degradation. This improves the intrinsic . . . },

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Complior device (Alam Medical, France) was used in epidemiological studies which established pulse wave velocity (PWV) as a cardiovascular risk marker. Central pressure is related, but complementary to PWV and also associated to cardiovascular outcomes. The new Complior Analyse measures both PWV and central blood pressure during the same acquisition. The aim of this study was to compare PWV values from Complior Analyse with the previous Complior SP (PWVcs) and with Sphygmocor (PWVscr; AtCor, Australia), and to compare central systolic pressure from Complior Analyse and Sphygmocor. METHOD: Peripheral and central pressures and PWV were measured with the three devices in 112 patients. PWV measurements from Complior Analyse were analysed using two foot-detection algorithms (PWVca{\_}it and PWVca{\_}cs). Both radial (ao-SBPscr) and carotid (car-SBPscr) approaches from Sphygmocor were compared to carotid Complior Analyse measurements (car-SBPca). The same distance and same calibrating pressures were used for all devices. RESULTS: PWVca{\_}it was strongly correlated to PWVscr (R(2) = 0.93, P {\textless} 0.001) with a difference of 0.0 ± 0.7 m/s. PWVca{\_}cs was also correlated to PWVcs (R(2) = 0.90, P {\textless} 0.001) with a difference of 0.1 ± 0.7 m/s. Central systolic pressures were strongly correlated. The difference between car-SBPca and ao-SBPscr was 3.1 ± 4.2 mmHg (P {\textless} 0.001), statistically equivalent to the difference between car-SBPscr and ao-SBPscr (3.9 ± 5.8 mmHg, P {\textless} 0.001), whilst the difference between car-SBPca and car-SBPscr was negligible (-0.7 ± 5.6 mmHg, P = NS). CONCLUSION: The new Complior Analyse device provides equivalent results for PWV and central pressure values to the Sphygmocor and Complior SP. It reaches Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation standard for central blood pressure and grades as excellent for PWV on the Artery Society criteria. It can be interchanged with existing devices.},

Ejection time was measured from the carotid or subclavian pulse tracing, and stroke volume was derived from direct measurements of blood flow. In normal individuals, ejection time varied inversely with heart rate and directly with stroke volume. In patients with nonvalvular heart disease and cardiac failure, ejection time was usually low relative to heart rate but tended to fall within normal limits relative to stroke volume. At the level of stroke volume observed in the patients with congestive heart failure, the mean rate of left ventricular ejection was within normal limits. Prolongation of ejection time relative to stroke volume was observed in patients with aortic insufficiency and in those with isolated aortic stenosis. The degree of prolongation in ejection time was well correlated with the severity of the aortic valvular disease. In patients with mitral valvular disease, including isolated mitral stenosis, as well as in those with mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, ejection time fell within the normal range relative to stroke volume. In patients with severe hypertensive disease, ejection time fell within the normal or low normal range relative to stroke volume. In 3 patients with pericardial disease an abnormal phasic respiratory variation in ejection time was observed. The present observations on temporal phenomena in cardiac ejection suggests the practical application of these techniques in the evaluation of patients with various cardiovascular disorders.},

In subjects at rest (n=43), values obtained using the foot-to-foot method (SphygmoCor system) were 1.7+/-0.75 m/s (mean+/-SD) greater than those obtained using the maximum slope (Complior system) at a mean value of 12 m/s. Isoprotenerol (0.5 to 1.5 microg/min; n=10), and pacing (in subjects with permanent pacemakers; n=11) increased heart rate but had differential effects on systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure. The increase in heart rate produced by isoprotenerol (18+/-3 bpm) and pacing (40 bpm) was associated with an increase in PWV measured using both systems (increases of 0.7+/-0.2 m/s and 0.9+/-0.2 m/s for SphygmoCor and Complior, respectively, during isoprotenerol and increases of 2.1+/-0.5 m/s and 1.1+/-0.2 m/s for SphygmoCor and Complior, respectively, during pacing, each P{\textless}0.001). Reanalysis of waveforms recorded from the Complior system using the foot-to-foot method produced similar values of PWV to those obtained with the SphygmoCor, confirming that the difference between these systems was attributable to the timing algorithm rather than other aspects of signal acquisition. Carotid-femoral PWV is critically dependent on the method used to determine propagation time, but this does not account for variation of PWV with heart rate.},

abstract = {The Complior device (Alam Medical, France) has contributed to the rise of arterial stiffness as a measure of cardiovascular risk. In its latest version (Complior Analyse) the sensor records pressure instead of distension waveforms thus allowing the measurement of central pressure and pulse wave analysis. The aim of our study was to verify that the new sensor measures pressure waveforms accurately in both time and frequency domain. Invasive and non-invasive signals were recorded simultaneously at the radial artery and compared in the frequency and time domain in haemodynamically stable intensive care unit patients. Twelve patients entered the study (8 men, 4 women, mean age 69 ± 17 years). Heart rate was 90 ± 15 bpm, systolic blood pressure 133 ± 19 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure 68 ± 15 mmHg. There was no statistical difference in the amplitude of harmonics between the invasive signal and Complior signal. When superimposing waveforms in the time domain, there was a small difference in the form factor (4.2 ± 2.8 {\%}) and in the absolute area between the 2 waveforms (3.3 ± 1.7 mmHg{\textperiodcentered}s(-1)). These differences were of the same magnitude as the beat-to-beat variation of the form factor (3.3 {\%}) and of the absolute area (3.1 mmHg{\textperiodcentered}s(-1)), respectively. The second systolic peak was detectable in 4 subjects, with no statistical difference between invasive and non-invasive values. The new pressure sensor of the Complior Analyse device recorded pressure waveforms accurately and could be used to perform pressure wave analysis.},

A low ankle brachial index (ABI) is an indicator of atherosclerosis and has the potential to improve prediction. ObjectiveTo determine if the ABI provides information on the risk of cardiovascular events and mortality independently of the Framingham risk score (FRS) and can improve risk prediction. Data SourcesRelevant studies were identified. A search of MEDLINE (1950 to February 2008) and EMBASE (1980 to February 2008) was conducted using common text words for the termankle brachial indexcombined with text words and Medical Subject Headings to capture prospective cohort designs. Review of reference lists and conference proceedings, and correspondence with experts was conducted to identify additional published and unpublished studies. Study Selection Studies were included if participants were derived from a general population, ABI was measured at baseline, and individuals were followed up to detect total and cardiovascular mortality. Data ExtractionPrespecified data on individuals in each selected study were extracted into a combined data set and an individual participant data meta-analysis was conducted on individuals who had no previous history of coronary heart disease. ResultsSixteen population cohort studies fulfilling the inclusion criteria were included. During 480 325 person-years of follow-up of 24 955 men and 23 339 women, the risk of death by ABI had a reverse J-shaped distribution with a normal (low risk) ABI of 1.11 to 1.40. The 10-year cardiovascular mortality in men with a low ABI (0.90) was 18.7{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 13.3{\%}-24.1{\%}) and with normal ABI (1.11-1.40) was 4.4{\%} (95{\%} CI, 3.2{\%}-5.7{\%}) (hazard ratio [HR], 4.2; 95{\%} CI, 3.3-5.4). Corresponding mortalities in women were 12.6{\%} (95{\%} CI, 6.2{\%}-19.0{\%}) and 4.1{\%} (95{\%} CI, 2.2{\%}-6.1{\%}) (HR, 3.5; 95{\%} CI, 2.4-5.1). The HRs remained elevated after adjusting for FRS (2.9 [95{\%} CI, 2.3-3.7] for men vs 3.0 [95{\%} CI, 2.0-4.4] for women). A low ABI (0.90) was associated with approximately twice the 10-year total mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and major coronary event rate compared with the overall rate in each FRS category. Inclusion of the ABI in cardiovascular risk stratification using the FRS would result in reclassification of the risk category and modification of treatment recommendations in approximately 19{\%} of men and 36{\%} of women. ConclusionMeasurement of the ABI may improve the accuracy of cardiovascular risk prediction beyond the FRS.},

abstract = {Background: Atherosclerosis begins in the arterial wall, with endothelial dysfunction accompanied by functional and structural changes that influence arterial stiffness. Pulse contour analysis provides an assessment of compliance or elasticity of the large conduit arteries (C1) and small microcirculatory arteries (C2). In this study, the predictive value of reduced elasticity of these arteries was evaluated by follow-up of subjects who underwent pulse contour analysis at the University of Minnesota. Methods: Questionnaires were sent to 870 subjects who had radial artery pulse wave analysis performed between 1993 and 1999 using a noninvasive sensor, parameter estimating algorithm and modified Windkessel model of the circulation. Responses from 419 subjects {\textgreater} 19 years of age reported on any cardiovascular events including death, myocardial infarction, stroke, transient ischemic attacks, angina, or coronary or peripheral vascular interventional procedures. Results: Of the subjects, 168 (41{\%}) reported one or more cardiovascular events. Events were more common in those with elevated blood pressure, elevated cholesterol, diabetes, and family history of events. Age, reduced C1, and reduced C2 were univariate predictors of events. After adjusting for age, a 2-unit decrease in C2 remained a significant predictor (odds ratio 1.50, P {\textless} .001), whereas C1 was no longer predictive. Conclusion: Reduced small artery elasticity, which is a measure of endothelial dysfunction, is significantly associated with cardiovascular events independent of age. ?? 2003 American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd.},

Whitehall II study participants (3789 men; 1383 women) underwent carotid-femoral applanation tonometry at the mean age of 66 and again 4 years later. General adiposity by body mass index, central adiposity by waist circumference and waist:hip ratio, and fat mass percent by body impedance were assessed 5 years before and at baseline. In linear mixed models adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, and mean arterial pressure, all adiposity measures were associated with aortic stiffening measured as increase in pulse wave velocity (PWV) between baseline and follow-up. The associations were similar in the metabolically healthy and unhealthy, according to Adult Treatment Panel-III criteria excluding waist circumference. C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 levels accounted for part of the longitudinal association between adiposity and PWV change. Adjusting for chronic disease, antihypertensive medication and risk factors, standardized effects of general and central adiposity and fat mass percent on PWV increase (m/s) were similar (0.14, 95{\%} confidence interval: 0.05-0.24, P=0.003; 0.17, 0.08-0.27, P{\textless}0.001; 0.14, 0.05-0.22, P=0.002, respectively). Previous adiposity was associated with aortic stiffening independent of change in adiposity, glycaemia, and lipid levels across PWV assessments. We estimated that the body mass index-linked PWV increase will account for 12{\%} of the projected increase in cardiovascular risk because of high body mass index. General and central adiposity in later midlife were strong independent predictors of aortic stiffening. Our findings suggest that adiposity is an important and potentially modifiable determinant of arterial aging.},

However, this age association with pulse shape is less clear in younger subjects and for different peripheralmeasurement sites. The aim of this study was to determine the association between age and changesin pulse shape characteristics at the ears, fingers and toes. Photoplethysmography pulse waveforms were recorded non-invasively from the right and left sides at the ears, index fingers and great toes of 116 normal healthy human subjects. Their median age was 41 years (range 13–72) allowing four distinct age groups to be considered (subjects younger than 30 years, 30–39 years, 40–49 years and 50 years of age or older). Normalized ear, finger and toe pulse shapes were calculated, for the whole subject group, and for the subjects within each age group. The differences in shape, relative to the oldest group,were also calculated for two distinct regions of interest; the systolic rising edge and the dicrotic notch of the pulse. Subtle, gradual and significant changes in the pulse shape were found at all sites with overall elongation of the systolic rising edge ( p {\textless} 0.05) and damping of the dicrotic notch ( p {\textless} 0.05) with age. The overall age-related changes in multi- site PPG pulse shape characteristics at the ear, finger and toe sites have been demonstrated and quantified.

abstract = {To measure the stiffness of the aorta, femoral artery and tibial artery noninvasively, cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) which is independent of blood pressure was developed. The formula for measuring this index is; CAVI=a{\{}(2rho/DeltaP) x ln(Ps/Pd)PWV(2){\}} + b where, Ps and Pd are systolic and diastolic blood pressures respectively, PWV is pulse wave velocity between the heart and ankle, DeltaP is Ps - Pd, rho is blood density, and a and b are constants. This equation was derived from Bramwell-Hill's equation(1)), and stiffness parameter(2)). To elucidate the clinical utility of CAVI, the reproducibility and dependence on blood pressure were studied using VaSera (Fukuda Denshi Co., Ltd.). Furthermore, CAVI in hemodialysis patients with or without atherosclerotic diseases was measured. The average coefficient of variation for five measurements among 22 persons was 3.8{\%}. In hemodialysis patients (n = 482), CAVI was correlated weakly with systolic and diastolic blood pressures (R = 0.175, 0.006), while brachial-ankle PWV was correlated strongly with systolic and diastolic blood pressures (R = 0.463, 0.335). CAVI in hemodialysis patients without signs of atherosclerotic diseases (NA) was 8.1 +/- 0.3 (mean +/- SD).

abstract = {BACKGROUND It has been well established that arterial stiffness, manifest as an increase in arterial pulse wave velocity or late systolic amplification of the carotid artery pressure pulse, increases with age. However, the populations studied in prior investigations were not rigorously screened to exclude clinical hypertension, occult coronary disease, or diabetes. Furthermore, it is unknown whether exercise capacity or chronic physical endurance training affects the age-associated increase in arterial stiffness. METHODS AND RESULTS Carotid arterial pressure pulse augmentation index (AGI), using applanation tonometry, and aortic pulse wave velocity (APWV) were measured in 146 male and female volunteers 21 to 96 years old from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, who were rigorously screened to exclude clinical and occult cardiovascular disease. Aerobic capacity was determined in all individuals by measurement of maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) during treadmill exercise. In this healthy, largely sedentary cohort, the arterial stiffness indexes AGI and APWV increased approximately fivefold and twofold, respectively, across the age span in both men and women, despite only a 14{\%} increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP). These age-associated increases in AGI and APWV were of a similar magnitude to those in prior studies of less rigorously screened populations. Both AGI and APWV varied inversely with VO2max, and this relationship, at least for AGI, was independent of age. In endurance trained male athletes, 54 to 75 years old (VO2max = 44 +/- 3 mL.kg-1.min-1), the arterial stiffness indexes were significantly reduced relative to their sedentary age peers (AGI, 36{\%} lower; APWV, 26{\%} lower) despite similar blood pressures. CONCLUSIONS Even in normotensive, rigorously screened volunteers in whom SBP increased an average of only 14{\%} between ages 20 and 90 years, major age-associated increases of arterial stiffness occur. Higher physical conditioning status, indexed by VO2max, was associated with reduced arterial stiffness, both within this predominantly sedentary population and in endurance trained older men relative to their less active age peers. These findings suggest that interventions to improve aerobic capacity may mitigate the stiffening of the arterial tree that accompanies normative aging.},

The stiffness indices were calculated from the relation between systemic blood pressure and arterial diameter. With advancing age there was a significant increase in the diameter of all arteries with a reduction in percentage change in diameter. The stiffness index increased with age in all arteries; however, in the brachial and femoral arteries there was considerable variation in the individual values for a given age. The age associated increase in stiffness was statistically significant only in the common carotid artery and the abdominal aorta. Although the mechanical properties of the peripheral arteries were significantly influenced by the measuring environment, the calculated stiffness indices were less vulnerable to these stimuli in the central arteries. These results indicate that the stiffness indices of the peripheral muscular arteries are modified appreciably by vasoactive stimuli and that the mechanical properties of the deeper elastic arteries provide sufficiently reliable information about changes caused by aging and arteriosclerosis. The new ultrasonic method used appears to be suitable for this analysis.},

Conse-quently, it is imperative that terminology to communicate across these disciplines is consistent and meaningful. In 1960, Peterson et al 1 suggested coining a new definition of elastic modulus, the ratio of stress to strain, in terms of the pulse pressure, ⌬P, and the directly measurable parameters ⌬D and D (diameter). This has subsequently become known as Peterson's modulus (Ep), where (1) Epϭ⌬P/(⌬D/D) In 1975, one of us (R.G.G.) 2 suggested calling the inverse of Ep the arterial compliance, C, where (2) Cϭ(⌬D/D)/⌬P However, since that date, various authors have used the term distensibility for this quantity (eg, most recently O'Rourke et al 3), and the term compliance has also become strongly linked with adherence to medical advice. The au-thors would therefore suggest that this difference in termi-nology is best resolved by using the long-established, engi-neering term compressibility when referring to the inverse of the elastic modulus. 4,5 Thus, use of the well-defined, longer-established terms, elastic modulus and compressibility, would replace the need to use the terms compliance and distensibility, about whose mathematical definition some confusion exists in the literature.},

abstract = {Rationale and Objectives: To establish the normal criterion of ascending aortic diameter (AAOD) measured by 64 multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) and electron beam computed tomography (EBT) based on gender and age. Materials and Methods: A total of 1442 consecutive subjects who were referred for evaluation of possible coronary artery disease underwent coronary computed tomographic (CT) angiography (CTA) and coronary artery calcium scanning (CACS) (55 + 11 years, 65{\%} male) without known coronary heart disease, hypertension, chronic pulmonary and renal disease, diabetes, and severe aortic calcification. The AAOD aortic diameter, descending aortic diameter (DAOD), pulmonary artery (PAD), and chest anteroposterior diameter (CAPD), posterior border of the sternal bone to the anterior border of the spine, were measured at the slice level of mid-right pulmonary artery using end systolic trigger imaging. The volume of four chambers, ejection fraction of left ventricle, and cardiac output were measured in 56{\%} of the patients. Patients' demographic information, age, gender, weight, height, and body surface area were recorded. The mean value and age-specific and gender-adjusted upper normal limits (mean ?? 2 standard deviation) were calculated. The linear correlation analysis was done between AAOD and all parameters. The reproducibility, wall thickness, and difference between end-systole and end-diastole were calculated. Results: AAOD has significant linear association with age, gender, DAOD, and pulmonary artery diameter (P {\textless} .05). There is no significant correlation between AAOD and body surface area, four-chamber volume, left ventricular ejection fraction, cardiac output, and CAPD. The mean intraluminal AAOD was 31.1 ?? 3.9 and 33.6 ?? 4.1 mm in females and males, respectively. The upper normal limits (mean ?? 2 standard deviations) of intraluminal AAOD, were 35.6, 38.3, and 40 mm for females and 37.8, 40.5, and 42.6 mm for males in age groups 20-40, 41-60, and older than 60 years, respectively. Intraluminal aortic diameters should parallel echocardiography and invasive angiography. Traditional cross-sectional imaging (with CT and magnetic resonance imaging) includes the vessel wall. The mean total AAOD was 33.5 and 36.0 mm in females and males, respectively. The upper normal limits (mean ?? 2 standard deviations) of intraluminal AAOD were 38.0, 40.7 and 42.4 mm for females and 40.2, 42.9, and 45.0 mm for males in age group 20 to 40, 41 to 60, and older than 60 years, respectively. The inter- and intraobserver, scanner, and repeated measurement variabilities were low (r value {\textgreater}0.91, P {\textless} .001, coefficient variation {\textless}3.2{\%}). AAOD was 1.7 mm smaller in end-diastole than end-systole (P {\textless} .001). Conclusions: The AAOD increases with age and male gender. Gender-specific and age-adjusted normal values for aortic diameters are necessary to differentiate pathologic atherosclerotic changes in the ascending aorta. Use of intraluminal or total aortic diameter values depends on the comparison study employed. ?? 2008 AUR.},

At rest in the sitting position, age-associated declines in heart rate (HR) and increases in systolic blood pressure occurred in both sexes. Whereas resting cardiac index (CI) and total systemic vascular resistance (TSVR) in men did not vary with age, in women resting CI decreased 16{\%} and TSVR increased 46{\%} over the six-decade age span. Men, but not women, demonstrated an age-associated increase of approximately 20{\%} in sitting end-diastolic volume index (EDVI), end-systolic volume index (ESVI), and stroke volume index over this age span. Peak cycle work rate declined with age approximately 40{\%} in both sexes, but at any age it was greater in men than in women even after normalization for body weight. At peak effort, ejection fraction (EF), HR, and CI were reduced similarly with age while ESVI and TSVR were increased in both sexes; EDVI increased 35{\%} with age and stroke work index (SWI) rose 19{\%} in men, but neither was related to age in women; and stroke volume index did not vary with age in either sex. When hemodynamics were expressed as the change from rest to peak effort as an index of cardiovascular reserve function, both sexes demonstrated age-associated increases in EDVI and ESVI and reductions in EF, HR, and CI. However, the exercise-induced reduction in ESVI and the increases in EF, CI, and SWI from rest were greater in men than in women. Thus, age and gender each have a significant impact on the cardiac response to exhaustive upright cycle exercise.},

abstract = {Background: Indices of pressure wave reflection (RIDVP) and large artery stiffness (SIDVP) can be derived from the digital volume pulse (DVP). Indices obtained from the second derivative of the DVP have also been proposed to characterize vascular aging and effects of vasoactive drugs. Methods: We compared RIDVP and SIDVP with the indices a/b, a/c, a/d, and a/e calculated from sequential peaks of the second derivative of the DVP in 124 healthy men. The DVP was obtained by measuring infrared light transmission through the finger. In 10 men measurements were obtained at baseline and during intravenous infusion of glyceryl trinitrate (GTN, 3 to 300 ??g/min) and, on separate occasions, angiotensin II (AII, 75 to 300 ??g/min) and saline vehicle. Results: SIDVP was strongly associated with age (R = 0.63, P {\textless} .001) but little influenced by AII or GTN. RIDVP was weakly associated with age but showed a consistent dose-dependent increase during AII and a decrease during GTN. d/a was strongly associated with age (R = -0.66, P {\textless} .001), influenced by vasoactive drugs but did not change in a dose-dependent manner during GTN. Other second derivative indices were less strongly correlated with age and showed an inconsistent response to vasoactive drugs. Within subject standard deviations of SIDVP and d/a for measurements on different occasions were 2.1 and 5.4 "years of vascular aging" respectively. Conclusions: In healthy men, RIDVP may be a more reliable index of the effects of vasoactive drugs than d/a. SIDVP is similarly associated with age as is d/a, but less variable and may thus be a better index of vascular aging. ?? 2003 American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd.},

abstract = {Aging decreases the distensibility of large elastic arteries; however, the effects of age on the functional parameters of muscular, medium-sized arteries are not well determined. This study evaluated the consequences of aging on the functional parameters of the carotid and radial arteries in normotensive men. A total of 62 elderly subjects (aged 74+/-2 years) were compared with 87 young subjects (aged 35+/-3 years). Internal diameter and intima-media thickness (IMT) were measured by a high-resolution echo-tracking system to calculate distensibility and incremental elastic modulus (Einc). Although in the normal range, systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels were statistically different in the 2 groups at 128+/-19 and 74+/-13 mm Hg versus 121+/-27 and 71+/-18 mm Hg in the young and elderly subjects, respectively (P{\textless}0.05). At the carotid artery level, elderly subjects exhibited a greater IMT (742+/-144 versus 469+/-132 microm; P{\textless}0.01) and internal diameter (7067+/-828 versus 6062+/-1026 microm; P{\textless}0.01) than young subjects; elderly subjects also had lower distensibility (12+/-2 versus 21+/-2 kPa(-1) x 10(-3); P{\textless}0.01) and higher Einc (0.9+/-0.2 versus 0.7+/-0.3 kPa x 10(3); P{\textless}0.01). At the radial artery level, both IMT (240+/-42 versus 218+/-51 microm; P{\textless}0.01) and internal diameter (2685+/-432 versus 2491+/-444 microm; P{\textless}0.01) were greater in elderly subjects, but no differences in distensibility and Einc were observed between the 2 groups. All differences remained significant, even after adjusting for mean blood pressure. These results indicate that the increase of the internal diameter and IMT observed during the aging process can have opposite effects on the functional parameters of large elastic or medium-sized muscular arteries.},

abstract = {Measurements of biomechanical properties of arteries have become an important surrogate outcome used in epidemiological and interventional cardiovascular research. Structural and functional differences of vessels in the arterial tree result in a dampening of pulsatility and smoothing of blood flow as it progresses to capillary level. A loss of arterial elastic properties results a range of linked pathophysiological changes within the circulation including increased pulse pressure, left ventricular hypertrophy, subendocardial ischaemia, vessel endothelial dysfunction and cardiac fibrosis. With increased arterial stiffness, the microvasculature of brain and kidneys are exposed to wider pressure fluctuations and may lead to increased risk of stroke and renal failure. Stiffening of the aorta, as measured by the gold-standard technique of aortic Pulse Wave Velocity (aPWV), is independently associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes across many different patient groups and in the general population. Therefore, use of aPWV has been proposed for early detection of vascular damage and individual cardiovascular risk evaluation and it seems certain that measurement of arterial stiffness will become increasingly important in future clinical care. In this review we will consider some of the pathophysiological processes that result from arterial stiffening, how it is measured and factors that may drive it as well as potential avenues for therapy. In the face of an ageing population where mortality from atheromatous cardiovascular disease is falling, pathology associated with arterial stiffening will assume ever greater importance. Therefore, understanding these concepts for all clinicians involved in care of patients with cardiovascular disease will become vital.},

abstract = {To clarify the clinical usefulness of the second derivative of the waveform of the fingertip photoplethysmogram (SDPTG), we examined the relationship between the pattern of the SDPTG waveform and risk factors related to atherosclerosis in 1,495 boys and girls aged 9-17 years. The fingertip photoplethysmogram and its second derivative wave were automatically recorded from the second digit of the right hand with the subjects lying in a supine position. The SDPTG waveform consisted of a, b, c and d waves in systole and an e wave in diastole. The heights of the a and d waves were measured from the baseline, and the ratio of the height of the d wave to that of the a wave (d/a ratio) was calculated. The d/a ratio had a negative correlation with the systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressures (DBP), atherogenic index (AI) and immunoreactive insulin concentrations (IRI) after adjustment for age. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that the d/a ratio was associated more with body height than the risk factors for atherosclerosis in boys and girls at the growth period. The effect of sex- and height-specific cutoff values of the 10th percentile for the d/a ratio was therefore tested. The results showed that subjects with d/a ratios lower than the 10th percentile had significantly higher SBP, DBP, AI and IRI values compared to those with higher d/a ratios. These findings suggest that differences in the length of the vascular system, which are related to increases in body height, may modify the SDPTG waveform pattern during adolescence. When the body height as well as age and sex is adequately allowed for, the d/a ratio may be useful for the evaluation of arterial distensibility and for identification of individuals at an increased risk of developing atherosclerosis.},

However, the impact of cardiovascular risk factors on arterial stiffness and wave reflections and, particularly, how such effects are influenced by ageing has not been assessed within a single large population, covering a sufficiently wide age range. Therefore, we determined the extent to which age alters the impact of traditional cardiovascular risk factors on arterial stiffness and wave reflections. Aortic stiffness and wave reflections were assessed in 4421 individuals (age range 18 to 92 years). When treated as continuous variables, clinic systolic, diastolic, and pulse pressures and glucose levels were independently associated with stiffness, and, with the exception of diastolic pressure, these associations were more marked in older individuals. In contrast, clinic systolic and diastolic pressures and smoking were independently associated with wave reflections, with stronger associations observed in younger individuals. The impact of traditional cardiovascular risk factors on arterial stiffness and wave reflections is strongly dependent on age and is largely driven by blood pressure. Additional studies are required to assess the impact of these arterial measures on cardiovascular outcome within a single population.},

abstract = {The arterial pulse at any site is created by an impulse generated by the left ventricle as it ejects blood into the aorta, together with multiple impulses travelling in the opposite direction from reflecting sites in the peripheral circulation. The compound wave at any site depends on the pattern of ventricular ejection, the properties of large arteries, particularly their stiffness (which determines rate of propagation) and the distance to and impedance mismatch at reflecting sites. Physicians are familiar with waveform analysis in the time domain, as in the electrocardiogram (ECG) where the principal features are explicable on the basis of atrial depolarisation followed by ventricular depolarisation, then repolarisation. Effects of cardiac functional and structural disease can be inferred from the ECG. It is more difficult to make similar interpretations from the pulse waveform and clinicians usually use this only to count heart rate, extremes of the pressure pulse to express systolic and diastolic pressure, and (sometimes) time from wave foot to incisural notch to measure time of systole and diastole. More information can be gleaned from the shape of the arterial pressure wave through consideration of the factors which create it--on stiffening of large arteries with age, effects of drugs on smallest arteries, and changes in such arterial properties on left ventricular load and function. Such is a major challenge to future physicians. It is aided by better and more accurate methods for measuring flow and diameter as well as pressure waveforms, and by appropriate use of other analytic techniques such as analysis of the pulse in the frequency domain.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Aortic stiffening increases the transfers of high pressure and flow pulsatility to small cerebral vessels potentially causing the accumulation of vascular brain injury. Our aim was to investigate the prospective association of aortic stiffness with the risks of incident mild cognitive impairment and dementia. METHODS We studied 1101 dementia-free Framingham Offspring study participants (mean age, 69±6 years; 54{\%} women). Aortic stiffness was measured as carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity using applanation tonometry and modeled as a linear variable and the top 2 quintiles ({\textgreater}11.4 m/s). Outcomes were the 10-year risk of incident mild cognitive impairment and dementia, including clinically characterized Alzheimer disease. We observed 106, 77, and 59 events of mild cognitive impairment, all-cause dementia, and clinical Alzheimer disease, respectively. RESULTS After adjustment for age and sex, higher continuous aortic stiffness predicted an increased risk of mild cognitive impairment (hazard ratio, 1.40 [95{\%} confidence interval, 1.13-1.73]), all-cause dementia (hazard ratio, 1.45 [95{\%} confidence interval, 1.13-1.87]), and Alzheimer disease (hazard ratio, 1.41 [95{\%} confidence interval, 1.06-1.87]). In risk factor-adjusted statistical models, aortic stiffness remained a significant predictor of mild cognitive impairment but not incident dementia. In nondiabetics, the top 2 quintiles of aortic stiffness were associated with a higher risk of incident all-cause dementia across all statistical models. CONCLUSIONS Aortic stiffness was an independent predictor of incident mild cognitive impairment in the whole sample and with incident dementia in nondiabetics.

abstract = {The cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) is a new index of the overall stiffness of the artery from the origin of the aorta to the ankle. The most conspicuous feature of CAVI is its independence of blood pressure at the time of measurement.CAVI increases with age and in many arteriosclerotic diseases, such as coronary artery disease, carotid arteriosclerosis, chronic kidney disease and cerebrovascular disease, and is related to many coronary risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia and smoking. Furthermore, CAVI decreases by controlling diabetes mellitus and hypertension, and also by abstaining from smoking. This suggests that CAVI is a physiological surrogate marker of athero- or arteriosclerosis, and also might be an indicator of lifestyle modification.Recently, it has been reported that CAVI and several left ventricular functions are co-related, suggesting a connection between the heart muscle and vascular function.This review covers the principles of CAVI and our current knowledge about CAVI, focusing on its roles and future outlook.},

abstract = {A major reason for measuring arterial stiffness routinely in clinical practice in hypertensive patients comes from the recent demonstration that arterial stiffness has predictive value for cardiovascular events, which is independent of classical risk scores. In primary prevention, some "imaging biomarkers," such as arterial stiffness, enhance risk prediction to a higher extent than "circulating biomarkers." The aim of the present brief review is to address the concept of "surrogate endpoint" and to determine whether aortic stiffness meets the criteria that are requested by international guidelines: (1) Proof of concept: Do novel marker levels differ between subjects with and without outcome? (2) Prospective validation: Does the novel marker predict development of future outcomes in a prospective cohort or nested case-cohort study? (3) Incremental value: Does the novel marker add predictive information to established, standard risk markers? (4) Clinical utility: Does the novel risk marker change predicted risk sufficiently to change recommended therapy? (5) Clinical outcomes: Does use of the novel risk marker improve clinical outcomes, especially when tested in a randomized clinical trial? (6) Cost-effectiveness: Does use of the novel risk marker improve clinical outcomes sufficiently to justify the additional costs? In conclusion, although aortic stiffness meets the first 4 criteria, there is still a need for studies comparing aortic stiffness-guided therapeutic strategies with classic guidelines-guided strategies for preventing cardiovascular events. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of the current investigation was to test the hypothesis that age-related changes in augmentation index (AIx) are more prominent in younger individuals ({\textless}50 years), whereas changes in aortic stiffness per se are more marked in older individuals ({\textgreater}50 years). BACKGROUND: Aging exerts a number of deleterious changes in the cardiovascular system, and, in particular, on the large arteries. Previous studies have suggested that AIx and pulse wave velocity (PWV) increase linearly with age, yet epidemiological data concerning pulse pressure suggest that large artery stiffening predominantly occurs later in life. METHODS: Peripheral and central blood pressure, augmentation pressure (AP), and AIx were determined in 4,001 healthy, normotensive individuals, aged 18 to 90 years. Aortic and brachial PWV were also determined in a subset of 998 subjects. RESULTS: Peripheral and central pulse pressure, AP, AIx, and aortic and brachial PWV all increased significantly with age; however, the age-related changes in AIx and aortic PWV were non-linear, with AIx increasing more in younger individuals, whereas the changes in PWV were more prominent in older individuals. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that AIx might be a more sensitive marker of arterial stiffening and risk in younger individuals but aortic PWV is likely to be a better measure in older individuals. ?? 2005 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

abstract = {The local reflection coefficient (r) at the aortoiliac junction was estimated in vessels removed at autopsy from 15 females and 31 males aged 2 months to 88 years by calculating the characteristic impedance (Zc) of the abdominal aorta and the two common iliac arteries. Zc was evaluated for each vessel by measuring cross-sectional area from radiographs and propagation velocity of an isolated pressure impulse generated by a solenoid-driven piston connected to the distal end of the abdominal aorta, and detected at several sites a known distance from the junction. Attenuation coefficients in the aorta were estimated from the peak amplitude of the impulse at these several sites. We observed significant decreases with age in abdominal aortic attenuation coefficient (gamma = 0.053-5 x 10(-4) age [yr], r = -0.42, p less than 0.005), and the area ratio (AR) of the junction (sum of the iliac cross-sectional areas/aortic cross-sectional area) (AR = 0.93-0.002 x age [yr], r = -0.31, p less than 0.05). Bifurcation angle (Angle) and aortic propagation velocity (caorta) increased significantly (angle = 40.2 + 0.26 x age [yr], r = 0.41, p less than 0.01; caorta (ms-1) = 7.59 + 0.175 x age [yr], r = 0.69, p less than 0.0001). No significant association between age and iliac propagation velocity was found. On the basis of area measurements alone, it has been argued that the observed decrease in area ratio with age causes r to become more positive. The lack of age-related changes in iliac propagation velocity (and hence stiffness), an observation confirmed by most of the few reports in the literature, and the large increase in abdominal aortic stiffness, however, greatly outweighed the area ratio changes and caused a significant decline in reflection coefficient from +0.3 in early life to -0.3 in old age. (Reflection coefficient = 0.30-0.0065 x age [yr], r = -0.68, p less than 0.0001). Between the ages of 30 and 60 years, its absolute value was less than 0.1, confirming in vivo work on subjects within this age range. In children, a significant positive reflection at the distal end of the aorta will amplify the pulse wave in this region. As this vessel becomes stiffer with increasing age, amplification will increase, whereas the increasingly negative value of r will partially offset this rise, reducing pulse pressure on either side of the junction.},

abstract = {Age differences in height derived from cross-sectional studies can be the result of differential secular influences among the age cohorts. To determine the magnitude of height loss that accompanies aging, longitudinal studies are required. The authors studied 2,084 men and women aged 17–94 years enrolled from 1958 to 1993 in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, Baltimore, Maryland. On average, men's height was measured nine times during 15 years and women's height five times during 9 years. The rate of decrease in height was greater for women than for men. For both sexes, height loss began at about age 30 years and accelerated with increasing age. Cumulative height loss from age 30 to 70 years averaged about 3 cm for men and 5 cm for women; by age 80 years, it increased to 5 cm for men and 8 cm for women. This degree of height loss would account for an “artifactual” increase in body mass index of approximately 0.7 kg/m2 for men and 1.6 kg/m2 for women by age 70 years that increases to 1.4 and 2.6 kg/m2, respectively, by age 80 years. True height loss with aging must be taken into account when height (or indexes based on height) is used in physiologic or clinical studies. Am J Epidemiol 1999;150:969-77. },

abstract = {Normalized pulse volume (NPV) was advocated as a more valid measure for the assessment of finger vascular tone. Based on the optical model in the finger tip expressed by Lambert-Beer's law, NPV is expressed as ??Ia/I. Here, ??Ia is the intensity of pulsatile component superimposed on the transmitted light (I). Theoretically, NPV seems to be superior to the conventional pulse volume (PV; corresponding to ??Ia). Firstly, NPV is in direct proportion to ??Va, which is the pulsatile component of the arterial blood volume, in a more exact manner. Relatedly, NPV can be processed as if it is an absolute value. Secondly, the sensitivity of NPV during stressful stimulations is expected to be higher. These expectations were supported experimentally using 13 male students. Firstly, the correlation between cutaneous vascular resistance in the finger tip (CVR) and NPV was higher than that between CVR and PV among all the subjects, although there was not much difference between these correlations within each subject. Secondly, NPV decreased much more than PV during mental stress. Some limitations of the present study were addressed, including the point that certain factors can violate the direct proportional relationship of NPV and PV to ??Va.

abstract = {The timing of Korotkoff sounds, blood pressure and heart rate can now be monitored in the ambulatory patient: the QKD interval is the time between the onset of the depolarization on the electrocardiogram (Q) and detection of the last Korotkoff sound (K) at the level of brachial artery during cuff deflation, corresponding to diastolic blood pressure (D). Because this interval is inversely related to pulse wave velocity, this recently developed device enables evaluation of the influence of blood pressure on arterial rigidity, providing valuable information on the properties of the arteries. In this study, we examined the influence of hypertension and age on the above parameters and their correlations to left ventricular mass. QKD interval, blood pressure, and heart rate were monitored over a period of 24 h (four measurements/hour) in 33 normotensive and 70 untreated essential hypertensive patients. The slopes of the plots of QKD interval versus systolic and pulse pressure during the 24 h were calculated for each patient. The influence of age and hypertension on these slopes was tested by comparison of matched groups and multivariate analysis. Moreover the relationships between these parameters and echocardiographically assessed left ventricular mass were studied in 37 patients. We found a reduction in mean QKD interval with age and hypertension, reflecting the recognized higher pulse wave velocity in these patients. The slopes of the plots of QKD interval versus blood pressure were also lower in these patients, indicating the smaller influence of a change in blood pressure on pulse wave velocity in patients with stiffer arteries. Both average 24-h systolic blood pressure and the slope of QKD interval versus pulse pressure were significantly and independently correlated to left ventricular mass index. The influence of blood pressure on arterial rigidity can be evaluated by this new monitoring device. Our results showed that pulse wave velocity was less affected by a change in blood pressure in the patients with the stiffer arteries.},

abstract = {Background: Several new techniques exist for measuring arterial stiffness, but their association with central pulse wave velocity (PWV), an established measure of central arterial stiffness, has not been compared in the same study. The aim of this study was to compare the agreement of the new techniques with central PWV. Methods: Fifteen men with coronary artery disease (59 ?? 2 years of age) and 15 healthy men (28 ?? 1 years of age) were recruited. The following measures were performed in a random sequence and repeated after 1 week: central and distal pulse wave velocity (PWV), large and small artery compliance (C1 and C2, respectively), and stroke volume/pulse pressure (SV/PP) (measured by HDI/PulseWave CR-2000), augmentation index (AIx) and central pulse pressure (CPR) (Sphygmocor), stiffness index (SI) (Micro Medical Pulse Trace), systemic arterial compliance (SAC) (area method), and brachial PP (Dinamap). Methods were compared using correlation coefficients and Bland-Altman analysis. Results: Although all measures of arterial stiffness except PWV correlated significantly with central PWV (P {\textless}. 01 for each), Bland-Altman analysis showed poor agreement (confidence interval [CI] {\textgreater}3 Z-scores) between central PWV and C1, C2, SV/PP, and SAC). There was good agreement (CI {\textgreater} 2 Z-scores) between central PWV and SI, AIx, CPP, and brachial PP. The coefficient of variation was lowest with central PWV (7.6{\%}), brachial PP (8.0{\%}), and SV/PP (8.6{\%}) and was significantly higher (P {\textless}. 05) in increasing order with C1 (11.3{\%}), C2 (15.6{\%}), SI (17.8{\%}), SAC (19.3{\%}), AIx (22.4{\%}), and CPP (25.3{\%}). Conclusions: Based on our study findings, C1, C2, SV/PP, and SAC show poor agreement with central PWV, an established measure of central arterial stiffness. Indices of this type should therefore be useful in providing a more complete understanding of arterial stiffness. In comparison, SI, AIx, and CPP are more closely related to central arterial stiffness. ?? 2005 American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd.},

We prospectively evaluated the prognostic value of AS and LVM in patients with essential hypertension. The population studied comprised 793 patients (56{\%} men) aged 54+/-14 years. For 519 patients, baseline measurements were made before any antihypertensive treatment, for 274 patients, the measurement were obtained during the follow-up period under antihypertensive treatment. AS was assessed from ambulatory monitoring of blood pressure and timing of Korottkoff sounds. Left ventricular mass was measured in 523 patients. After a mean follow-up of 97 months, 122 cardiovascular events were recorded in the whole population and 74 in the group with LVM determination. AS as continuous or discontinuous variable was independently related to cardiovascular events. The existence or not of antihypertensive treatment at the time of its measurement did not affect its prognostic value. When LVM was forced in the model, AS remained significantly related to cardiovascular events. Thus, AS has an independent prognostic value in the hypertensive, whether measured before or after the administration of antihypertensive treatment.

abstract = {Objectives: The purpose of this study was to calculate robust quantitative estimates of the predictive value of aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) for future cardiovascular (CV) events and all-cause mortality by meta-analyses of longitudinal studies. Background: Arterial stiffness is increasingly recognized as a surrogate end point for CV disease. Methods: We performed a meta-analysis of 17 longitudinal studies that evaluated aortic PWV and followed up 15,877 subjects for a mean of 7.7 years. Results: The pooled relative risk (RR) of clinical events increased in a stepwise, linear-like fashion from the first to the third tertile of aortic PWV. The pooled RRs of total CV events, CV mortality, and all-cause mortality were 2.26 (95{\%} confidence interval: 1.89 to 2.70, 14 studies), 2.02 (95{\%} confidence interval: 1.68 to 2.42, 10 studies), and 1.90 (95{\%} confidence interval: 1.61 to 2.24, 11 studies), respectively, for high versus low aortic PWV subjects. For total CV events and CV mortality, the RR was significantly higher in high baseline risk groups (coronary artery disease, renal disease, hypertension) compared with low-risk subjects (general population). An increase in aortic PWV by 1 m/s corresponded to an age-, sex-, and risk factor-adjusted risk increase of 14{\%}, 15{\%}, and 15{\%} in total CV events, CV mortality, and all-cause mortality, respectively. An increase in aortic PWV by 1 SD was associated with respective increases of 47{\%}, 47{\%}, and 42{\%}. Conclusions: Aortic stiffness expressed as aortic PWV is a strong predictor of future CV events and all-cause mortality. The predictive ability of arterial stiffness is higher in subjects with a higher baseline CV risk. ?? 2010 American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

We aimed to obtain a range of arterial stiffness values, and investigated the influence of age, gender, race, body mass index, fasting lipids and haemodynamic factors. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-two healthy subjects, aged between 18 and 67 years, on no medications and with no significant medical illnesses were recruited. The population was predominantly Caucasian (n = 112). Two measures of arterial stiffness were obtained: stiffness index (SI), a measure of large arterial stiffness, and reflection index (RI), a measure of small to medium-sized arterial stiffness. SI and RI were significantly correlated with age, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Race was a significant independent predictor of SI. CONCLUSION: Digital photoplethysmography is a portable, operator-independent, reproducible and simple method of measuring arterial stiffness. Ranges of normality of arterial stiffness will depend on the individual's age, race, lipid levels, HR and blood pressure.},

BACKGROUND Aging exerts a number of deleterious changes in the cardiovascular system, and, in particular, on the large arteries. Previous studies have suggested that AIx and pulse wave velocity (PWV) increase linearly with age, yet epidemiological data concerning pulse pressure suggest that large artery stiffening predominantly occurs later in life. METHODS Peripheral and central blood pressure, augmentation pressure (AP), and AIx were determined in 4,001 healthy, normotensive individuals, aged 18 to 90 years. Aortic and brachial PWV were also determined in a subset of 998 subjects. RESULTS Peripheral and central pulse pressure, AP, AIx, and aortic and brachial PWV all increased significantly with age; however, the age-related changes in AIx and aortic PWV were non-linear, with AIx increasing more in younger individuals, whereas the changes in PWV were more prominent in older individuals. CONCLUSIONS These data suggest that AIx might be a more sensitive marker of arterial stiffening and risk in younger individuals but aortic PWV is likely to be a better measure in older individuals.},

abstract = {The decline in stature with age among adults is well documented. Although part of this represents a birth cohort effect, actual height declines among older individuals are known to contribute to the effect. In this study we used longitudinal changes in the heights of adults in a general population sample to determine the rate of decline in height over time in individuals of different ages. This allowed an estimation of the age at which decline in height begins, a value close to age 40 in both sexes. It also allowed derivation of equations from which the maximum height of subjects can be estimated on the basis of their sex, current height, and age. These equations should prove useful when examining the effect of aging per se on physiological measurements that are height dependent. The data also allow one to compare the magnitude of the effect of year of birth with that of the actual decline in height seen among the elderly. We estimate that approximately 60{\%} of the smaller stature of older male subjects and 45{\%} of the smaller stature of older female subjects is a birth cohort effect deriving from the secular trend toward greater stature; the remainder is a result of an actual decrement in height after the age of 40.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND By contrast with other southern European people, north Portuguese population registers an especially high prevalence of hypertension and stroke incidence. We designed a cohort study to identify individuals presenting accelerated and premature arterial aging in the Portuguese population. METHOD Pulse wave velocity (PWV) was measured in randomly sampled population dwellers aged 18-96 years from northern Portugal, and used as a marker of early vascular aging (EVA). Of the 3038 individuals enrolled, 2542 completed the evaluation. RESULTS Mean PWV value for the entire population was 8.4 m/s (men: 8.6 m/s; women: 8.2 m/s; P {\textless} 0.02). The individuals were classified with EVA if their PWV was at least 97.5th percentile of z-score for mean PWV values adjusted for age (using normal European reference values as comparators). The overall prevalence of EVA was 12.5{\%}; 26.1{\%} of individuals below 30 years presented this feature and 40.2{\%} of individuals in that same age strata were placed above the 90th percentile of PWV; and 18.7{\%} of the population exhibited PWV values above 10 m/s, with male predominance (17.2{\%} of men aged 40-49 years had PWV {\textgreater} 10 m/s). Logistic regression models indicated gender differences concerning the risk of developing large artery damage, with women having the same odds of PWV above 10 m/s 10 years later than men. CONCLUSION The population PWV values were higher than expected in a low cardiovascular risk area (Portugal). High prevalence rates of EVA and noteworthy large artery damage in young ages were found.},

abstract = {Pulse examination by palpation of a peripheral artery against a bony prominence is the most commonly used and widely accepted method. However this is subjective and thus prone to errors. Although pulse waveform was recorded in the 19th century, it did not gain popularity because of inconvenience in using the recording instruments and the absence of a sound theory to explain the wave forms recorded. Sphygmomanometry for recording blood pressure gained popularity as it was easy to record and had a sound theoretical background. Sphygmomanometry provides two extreme values of blood pressure but does not give a true representation of the blood pressure changes occurring in the entire cardiac cycle. Recently there has been resurgence in the analysis of the graphical recording of the pulse wave. Photoplethysmography is becoming a widely accepted technique in assessing the volume pulse. The whole review is about historical background, non-invasive methods of pulse recording, relation of the digital volume pulse to the pressure pulse and the advantages of recording the pressure pulse.},

abstract = {Arterial pressure is a cyclic phenomenon characterized by a pressure wave oscillating around the mean blood pressure, from diastolic to systolic blood pressure, defining the pulse pressure. Aortic input impedance is a measure of the opposition of the circulation to an oscillatory flow input (stroke volume generated by heart work). Aortic input impedance integrates factors opposing LV ejection, such as peripheral resistance, viscoelastic properties and dimensions of the large central arteries, and the intensity and timing of the pressure wave reflections, associated with the opposition to LV ejection influenced by inertial forces. The two most frequently used methods of arterial stiffness are measurement of PWV and central (aortic or common carotid artery) pulse wave analysis, recorded directly at the carotid artery or indirectly in the ascending aorta from radial artery pressure curve. The arterial system is heterogenous and characterized by the existence of a stiffness gradient with progressive stiffness increase (PWV) from ascending aorta and large elastic proximal arteries to the peripheral muscular conduit arteries. Analysis of aortic or carotid pressure waveform and amplitude concerns the effect of reflected waves on pressure shape and amplitude, estimated in absolute terms, augmented pressure in millimetre of mercury, or, in relative terms, 'augmentation index' (Aix in percentage of pulse pressure). Finally, if the aortic PWV has the highest predictive value for prognosis, the aortic or central artery pressure waveform should be recorded and analysed in parallel with the measure of PWV to allow a deeper analysis of arterial haemodynamics.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To clarify the factors influencing two measures of arterial stiffness, pulse wave velocity (PWV) and the second derivative of the finger photoplethysmogram (SDPTG), and to evaluate their relationship in treated hypertensive subjects. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The subjects were 294 hypertensive patients aged 32-91 years (mean, 61.4 +/- 10.5 years). After blood pressure (BP) was measured, carotid-femoral PWV and SDPTG were recorded with the subjects in the supine position, with the aid of an automatic device. For assessing SDPTG, we focused mainly on the ratios of the absolute value of the height of the early negative 'b' wave (B) and that of the late re-decreasing 'd' wave (D) to that of the initial positive 'a' wave (A), namely the B : A and D : A ratios, and the aging index (AGI). Factors influencing PWV and SDPTG indices, and the relationship between PWV and SDPTG indices were evaluated by bivariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: According to multiple linear regression analysis, age, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and heart rate (HR) were variables independently and positively correlated with PWV. The age and BP were significantly and independently related to SDPTG indices; there were positive correlations with the D : A ratio and AGI, and negative correlations with the B : A ratio. HR was correlated negatively with the D : A ratio and AGI, and positively with the B : A ratio. According to multiple logistic regression analysis, adjusted-odds ratios of high PWV, low B : A ratio, high D : A ratio, and high AGI were significantly elevated among the elderly and among the subjects with uncontrolled BP. Although PWV and the SDPTG indices were associated with common factors, including age and BP, bivariate analysis revealed that they were only weakly correlated with each other. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that in hypertensive patients, PWV and SDPTG provide different information about arterial properties at central and peripheral sites.},

abstract = {The method used for pulse transit time (PTT) estimation critically affects the accuracy and precision of regional pulse wave velocity (PWV) measurements. Several methods of PTT estimation exist, often yielding substantially different PWV values. Since there is no analytic way to determine PTT in vivo, these methods cannot be validated except by using in silico or in vitro models of known PWV and PTT values. We aimed to validate and compare the most commonly used "foot-to-foot" algorithms, namely, the " diastole-minimum," "tangential," "maximum first derivative," and "maximum second derivative" methods. Also, we propose a new "diastole-patching" method aiming to increase the accuracy and precision in PWV measurements. We simulated 2,000 cases under different hemodynamic conditions using an accurate, validated, distributed, one-dimensional arterial model. The new algorithm detects and "matches" a specific region of the pressure wave foot between the proximal and distal waveforms instead of determining characteristic points. The diastole-minimum and diastole-patching methods showed excellent agreement compared with "real" PWV values of the model, as indicated by high values of the intraclass correlation coefficient ({\textgreater}0.86). The diastole-patching method resulted in low bias (absolute mean difference: 0.26 m/s). In contrast, PWV estimated by the maximum first derivative, maximum second derivative, and tangentia methods presented low to moderate agreement and poor accuracy (intraclass correlation coefficient: {\textless}0.79 and bias: {\textgreater}0.9 m/s). The diastole-patching method yielded PWV measurements with the highest agreement, accuracy, and precision and lowest variability.},

abstract = {Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine whether the carotid/brachial (C/B) ratio is an independent predictor of cardiovascular (CV) risk. Background: Brachial and carotid pulse pressure (PP) are independent predictors of CV risk, mainly in elderly patients. Because PP is physiologically lower at the brachial than at the carotid arterial site, PP amplification is represented by the C/B ratio and could independently predict CV risk. Methods: In a Paris population (n = 834), brachial and carotid PP were measured from sphygmomanometry and pulse wave analysis. With stepwise multiple regression, carotid PP was calculated from a nomogram including age, sex, body height, brachial PP, and plasma glucose. This model was applied to 125,151 subjects, followed for 12 years, during which 3,997 deaths occurred (735 of CV origin). With Cox regression analysis, multi-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated for 1 SD increase of brachial PP, calculated carotid PP, and C/B ratio. Results: Brachial PP was significantly associated with both CV and all-cause mortality (HR: 1.16, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI]: 1.13 to 1.19, and HR: 1.13, 95{\%} CI: 1.10 to 1.17, respectively). Calculated carotid PP predicted a similar risk (HR: 1.21, 95{\%} CI: 1.15 to 1.28, and HR: 1.18, 95{\%} CI: 1.12 to 1.25, respectively). Finally, the C/B ratio was a strong risk predictor (HR: 1.22, 95{\%} CI: 1.12 to 1.32, and HR: 1.41, 95{\%} CI: 1.14 to 1.73, respectively). Addition of drug treatment and other confounding variables did not statistically modify the results. Conclusions: Brachial PP, calculated carotid PP, and C/B PP amplification all predict CV mortality. In contrast to brachial and carotid PP, the C/B ratio is less dependent on blood pressure calibration and thus can be directly applicable to large population studies. ?? 2010 American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

abstract = {Heart rate is a conventional index quantifying the pulsatile action of the heart and is a basic parameter used throughout medical history and prac- tice. However, modern science often places relatively little emphasis on heart rate in relation to the oscillatory nature of blood flow in the circula- tory system, and the unyielding cyclic stress on the heart and blood ves- sels. Heart rate is relevant not only as an elemental measure, but also as a statistical entity and a possible confounding factor when considering its interaction with vascular hemodynamics. Pulse pressure amplification from the central aorta to peripheral arteries increases with heart rate. This has significant implications when assessing vascular function based on peripheral (brachial) pressure measurements, as the pressure changes at the central aorta with changes in arterial stiffness (as occurs with age) can be markedly different from changes at the peripheral site at different heart rates. Similarly, heart rate is a significant parameter when assessing cardiac and vascular implications of anti-hypertensive drug treatments. Heart rate, itself an independent parameter of cardiovascular risk, should also be considered in the statistical treatment of cardiovascular risk fac- tors in large epidemiological studies. Disturbance in the regular pulsa- tile action of the heart due to altered synchrony of the cardiac chambers leads to heart failure, which can be treated with resychronization therapy. Cardiovascular models show that arterial stiffness can significantly affect the modification of parameters associated with cardiac resynchronization therapy. Thus, pulsatile hemodynamic parameters play a significant role when associated with both regular heart rate and with disturbed synchrony of the contracting heart chambers affecting the pump function of the heart.},

abstract = {The pulse wave velocity (PWV) and the photoplethysmogram (PTG) are noninvasive methods for evaluating the pulse wave. The PWV has been associated with age and arterial hypertension, and an index of the second derivative of PTG (SDPTG) is correlated with age and other risk factors for atherosclerosis. The aim of this study was to compare SDPTG and PWV concerning the influencing factors of vascular compliance, including age and atherosclerosis, in a large hypertensive population. We studied consecutively 524 essential hypertensives, 140 with atherosclerotic alterations (AA), defined on the basis of clinical events including coronary heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, stroke, and abdominal aorta aneurysm. The PWV carotid-femoral was measured by a Complior device and the SDPTG was recorded by Fukuda FCP-3166. The augmentation index (AUI) of PTG was defined as the ratio of the late systolic peak to that of the early systolic peak in the pulse. The SDPTG consists of an a,b,c, and d wave in systole and an e wave in diastole; an SDPTG aging index (AI) was calculated as (b-c-d-e)/a. The patients with AA presented a higher PWV (14.9 ?? 4 m/sec v 12.4 ?? 2 m/sec, P {\textless} .001), PTG AUI (0.322 ?? 0.16 v 0.252 ?? 0.09, P {\textless} .001), and SDPTG AI (- 0.093 ?? 0.03 v -0.271 ?? 0.018, P {\textless} .001). However, in patients 60 years of age, only PWV remained higher in those with AA, whereas in patients {\textgreater} 60 yr, both PWV and SDPTG AI remained higher in those with AA. The PWV was independently influenced by age, systolic blood pressure, glucose, AA, and plasma creatinine, whereas the PTG AUI was influenced by age and systolic pressure and the SDPTG AI by age and AA. In a logistic regression model for the presence of AA, including age, plasma creatinine, smoking, and diastolic BP, PWV was a significant independent determinant of AA, whereas SDPTG AI weakly entered into the model. This study provides evidence that the aortic PWV reflects better than the SDPTG the modifications of the arterial compliance related to age, blood pressure, and atherosclerosis. However, the SDPTG AI may be useful for evaluation of vascular aging in hypertensives. (C) 2000 American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd.},

@article{Rabben2004,
abstract = {In this paper, we present a method for estimating local pulse wave velocity (PWV) solely from ultrasound measurements: the area-flow (QA) method. With the QA method, PWV is estimated as the ratio between change in flow and change in cross-sectional area (PWV = dQ/dA) during the reflection-free period of the cardiac cycle. In four anaesthetized dogs and 21 human subjects (age 23-74) we measured the carotid flow and cross-sectional area non-invasively by ultrasound. As a reference method we used the Bramwell-Hill (BH) equation which estimates PWV from pulse pressure and cross-sectional area. Additionally, we therefore measured brachial pulse pressure by oscillometry in the human subjects, and central aortic pulse pressure by micro-manometry in the dogs. As predicted by the pressure dependency of arterial stiffness, the estimated PWV decreased when the aortic pressure was lowered in two of the dogs. For the human subjects, the QA and BH estimates were correlated (R=0.43, p{\textless}0.05) and agreed on average (mean difference of -0.14 m/s). The PWV by the BH method increased with age (p{\textless}0.01) whereas the PWV by the QA method tended to increase with age (p{\textless}0.1). This corresponded to a larger residual variance (residual = deviation of the estimated PWV from the regression line) for the QA method than for the BH method, indicating different precisions for the two methods. This study illustrates that the simple equation PWV = dQ/dA gives estimates correlated to the PWV of the reference method. However, improvements in the basic measurements seem necessary to increase the precision of the method.},

Patients with essential hypertension (n=296, male/female=161/135; age=61.1+/-0.7 years) were enrolled. We measured brachial-ankle PWV, femoral-ankle PWV and carotid-femoral PWV simultaneously, and evaluated target organ damage and associated clinical conditions (cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disease) using the World Health Organization classification modified in 1999. Carotid-femoral PWV (p{\textless}0.0001; r=0.521) and brachial-ankle PWV (p{\textless}0.0001; r=0.478) but not femoral-ankle PWV were significantly correlated with age. Carotid-femoral PWV was significantly higher in patients with associated clinical conditions compared with that in patients with target organ damage (p{\textless}0.05) and those with no complications (p{\textless}0.0001). Brachial-ankle PWV was significantly higher in patients with associated clinical conditions (p{\textless}0.05) and target organ damage (p{\textless}0.05) compared to those with no complications, but there was no significant difference in brachial-ankle PWV between these two groups. Moreover, femoral-ankle PWV was significantly lower in patients with associated clinical conditions compared with that in patients with target organ damage (p{\textless}0.05). These data suggest that brachial-ankle PWV could underestimate arterial stiffness in hypertensive patients with a history of cardiovascular events.},

abstract = {To evaluate the clinical application of the second derivative of the fingertip photoplethysmogram waveform, we performed drug administration studies (study 1) and epidemiological studies (study 2). In study 1, ascending aortic pressure was recorded simultaneously with the fingertip photoplethysmogram and its second derivative in 39 patients with a mean+/-SD age of 54+/-11 years. The augmentation index was defined as the ratio of the height of the late systolic peak to that of the early systolic peak in the pulse. The second derivative consists of an a, b, c, and d wave in systole and an e wave in diastole. Ascending aortic pressure increased after injection of 2.5 microg angiotensin from 126/74 to 160/91 mm Hg and decreased after 0.3 mg sublingual nitroglycerin to 111/73 mm Hg. The d/a, the ratio of the height of the d wave to that of the a wave, decreased after angiotensin from -0.40+/-0.13 to -0.62+/-0.19 and increased after nitroglycerin to -0.25+/-0.12 (P{\textless}0.001 and P{\textless}0.001, respectively). The negative d/a increased with increases in plethysmographic and ascending aortic augmentation indices (r=0.79, P{\textless}0.001, and r=0.80, P{\textless}0.001, respectively). The negative d/a reflects the late systolic pressure augmentation in the ascending aorta and may be useful for noninvasive evaluation of the effects of vasoactive agents. In study 2, the second derivative of the plethysmogram waveform was measured in a total of 600 subjects (50 men and 50 women in each decade from the 3rd to the 8th) in our health assessment center. The b/a ratio increased with age, and c/a, d/a, and e/a ratios decreased with age. Thus, the second derivative aging index was defined as b-c-d-e/a. The second derivative wave aging index (y) increased with age (x) (r=0.80, P{\textless}0.001, y=0.023x-1.515). The second derivative aging index was higher in 126 subjects with any history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and ischemic heart disease than in age-matched subjects without such a history (-0.06+/-0.36 versus -0.22+/-0.41, P{\textless}0.01).

With the recognition of the importance of arterial stiffness there has been a resurgence of interest in pulse wave analysis, particularly the analysis of the radial pressure pulse acquired using a tonometer. An alternative technique utilizes a volume pulse. This may conveniently be acquired optically from a finger (digital volume pulse). Although less widely used, this technique deserves further consideration because of its simplicity and ease of use. As with the pressure pulse, the contour of the digital volume pulse is sensitive to changes in arterial tone induced by vasoactive drugs and is influenced by ageing and large artery stiffness. Measurements taken directly from the digital volume pulse or from its second derivative can be used to assess these properties. This review describes the background to digital volume pulse contour analysis, how the technique relates to contour analysis of the pressure pulse, and current and future applications.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Arterial distensibility measures, generally from pulse-wave velocity (PWV), are widely used with little knowledge of relationships to patient outcome. We tested whether aortic PWV predicts cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in type 2 diabetes and glucose-tolerance-tested (GTT) multiethnic population samples. METHODS AND RESULTS: Participants were randomly sampled from (1) a type 2 diabetes outpatient clinic and (2) primary care population registers, from which nondiabetic control subjects were given a GTT. Brachial blood pressures and Doppler-derived aortic PWV were measured. Mortality data over 10 years' follow-up were obtained. At any level of systolic blood pressure (SBP), aortic PWV was greater in subjects with diabetes than in controls. Mortality risk doubled in subjects with diabetes (hazard ratio 2.34, 95{\%} CI 1.5 to 3.74) and in those with glucose intolerance (2.12, 95{\%} CI 1.11 to 4.0) compared with controls. For all groups combined, age, sex, and SBP predicted mortality; the addition of PWV independently predicted all-cause and cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio 1.08, 95{\%} CI 1.03 to 1.14 for each 1 m/s increase) but displaced SBP. Glucose tolerance status and smoking were other independent contributors, with African-Caribbeans experiencing reduced mortality risk (hazard ratio 0.41, 95{\%} CI 0.25 to 0.69). CONCLUSIONS: Aortic PWV is a powerful independent predictor of mortality in both diabetes and GTT population samples. In displacing SBP as a prognostic factor, aortic PWV is probably further along the causal pathway for arterial disease and may represent a useful integrated index of vascular status and hence cardiovascular risk.},

abstract = {Use of local arterial distensibility measurements by change in carotid artery diameter divided by pulse pressure has limitations because blood pressure is often taken in a vessel distant or at a time different from where and when change in diameter is taken. In 92 subjects (23 to 91 years of age), carotid artery diameter was continuously measured ecographically, whereas blood pressure was continuously measured simultaneously tonometrically on the contralateral artery, the 2 signals being synchronized via 2 EKGs. Within each cardiac cycle, there was a linear relationship between the changes in vessel diameter and the changes in blood pressure during either the protomesosystole or the diastole after the dicrotic notch. The diastolic slope was displaced upward and steeper than the systolic slope, the pressure-diameter loop showing a hysteresis. Both slopes showed a high reproducibility when data were averaged over a several-second period. There were small differences between consecutive cardiac cycles, suggesting that modulation of arterial mechanical response to continuous changes in intravascular pressure may undergo physiological variations. In the 92 subjects, systolic and diastolic slopes correlated significantly with distensibility values obtained by Reneman formula and exhibited a close inverse relationship with each subject's age and systolic blood pressure, thereby showing the ability to reflect age- and pressure-dependent large artery stiffening. This method may allow precise assessment of man's arterial mechanical properties within each cardiac cycle. This highly dynamic assessment may help to collect information on properties of normal and altered large elastic arteries and the mechanisms involved in disease.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Age-related arterial stiffening and reduction of arterial elasticity are attenuated in individuals with high levels of cardiorespiratory fitness. Viscosity is another mechanical characteristic of the arterial wall; however, the effects of age and cardiorespiratory fitness have not been determined. We examined the associations among age, cardiorespiratory fitness and carotid arterial wall viscosity.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A total of 111 healthy men, aged 25-39 years (young) and 40-64 years (middle-aged), were divided into either cardiorespiratory fit or unfit groups on the basis of peak oxygen uptake. The common carotid artery was measured noninvasively by tonometry and automatic tracking of B-mode images to obtain instantaneous pressure and diameter hysteresis loops, and we calculated the effective compliance, isobaric compliance and viscosity index.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In the middle-aged men, the viscosity index was larger in the unfit group than in the fit group (2533 vs. 2018 mmHg{\textperiodcentered}s/mm, respectively: P{\textless}0.05), but this was not the case in the young men. In addition, effective and isobaric compliance were increased, and viscosity index was increased with advancing age, but these parameters were unaffected by cardiorespiratory fitness level.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: These results suggest that the wall viscosity in the central artery is increased with advancing age and that the age-associated increase in wall viscosity may be attenuated in cardiorespiratory fit men.},
annote = {--- ADD TO SUMMARY ---

- wall viscosity in the central artery is increased with age, although only in unfit individuals. Probably means that this age-related change can be ignored (since it doesn't exist unless subjects are unfit).

The article provides justification for saying that age-related changes in arterial wall viscosity haven't been investigated.},

abstract = {The determination of arterial wave speed and the separation of the forward and backward waves have been established using simultaneous measurements of pressure (P) and velocity (U). In this work, we present a novel algorithm for the determination of local wave speed and the separation of waves using the simultaneous measurements of diameter (D) and U. The theoretical basis of this work is the solution of the 1D equations of flow in elastic tubes. A relationship between D and U is derived, from which, local wave speed can be determined; C=+/-0.5(dU(+/-)/dlnD(+/-)). When only unidirectional waves are present, this relationship describes a linear relationship between lnD and U. Therefore, constructing a lnDU-loop should result in a straight line in the early part of the cycle when it is most probable that waves are running in the forward direction. Using this knowledge of wave speed, it is also possible to derive a set of equations to separate the forward and backward waves from the measured D and U waveforms. Once the forward and backward waveforms of D and U are established, we can calculate the energy carried by the forward and backward waves, in a similar way to that of wave intensity analysis. In this paper, we test the new algorithm in vitro and present results from data measured in the carotid artery of human and the ascending aorta of canine. We conclude that the new technique can be reproduced in vitro, and in different vessels of different species, in vivo. The new algorithm is easy to use to determine wave speed and separate D and U waveforms into their forward and backward directions. Using this technique has the merits of utilising noninvasive measurements, which would be useful in the clinical setting.},

abstract = {There has been much recent interest in the relationship between arterial stiffness and cardiovascular disease. Pulse pressure and pulse wave velocity, surrogate measures of arterial stiffness, indicate that arterial stiffness increases both with age and in certain disease states that are themselves associated with increased cardiovascular risk, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolaemia and end‐stage renal failure.1 As changes can be detected before the appearance of clinically apparent vascular disease, arterial stiffness may act either as a marker for the development of future atherosclerotic disease, or may be more directly involved in the process of atherosclerosis. Arterial stiffening has been particularly implicated in the development of isolated systolic hypertension, a disease mainly affecting the elderly population and associated with considerable excess morbidity and mortality.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nArterial stiffness may be measured using a variety of different techniques, although at present the majority of measurements are made for experimental and physiological studies rather than in clinical practice. However, it is likely that over the next few years measurement of arterial stiffness will become an increasingly important part of the process of risk assessment, and may possibly also improve the monitoring of therapy in patients with conditions such as isolated systolic hypertension. Therefore, it will become necessary for physicians both in primary care and hospital practice to understand the importance of arterial stiffness and the techniques available for its clinical assessment, which will be the focus of this review.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAssessment of the arterial pulse has always been an important part of clinical examination, and the ancients recognized that changes in the character of the pulse indicated the presence of disease.

abstract = {The pulsatile component of blood pressure (ie, pulse pressure) has received considerable attention as an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease. In particular, central blood pressure measurements in the ascending aorta or in the carotid artery are expected to be more useful than conventional brachial pressure measurements for predicting cardiovascular events because central pressure, not the brachial pressure, is the pressure that target organs encounter. Due to wave reflection, the blood pressure in the upper limb does not represent the central blood pressure; therefore, leading researchers have enthusiastically promoted a noninvasive method of measuring central blood pressure and the resulting aortic stiffness. Until now, there has been an increasing body of evidence to support the accuracy and superiority of central blood pressure measurements as well as the assessment of aortic properties over classical brachial pressure measurements. In this review, the information regarding these "central" indices derived from 2 main methods, namely "pulse wave analysis" and "pulse wave velocity", for the application of central blood pressure measurements and arterial stiffness to clinical study and practice, has been summarized.},

abstract = {Background: The use of ambulatory recordings of blood pressure (BP) was proposed to estimate arterial stiffness (AS). We compared the relative value of the ambulatory AS index (AASI), and of the slope of pulse pressure (PP) according to mean BP (MBP) obtained from 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring, to the monitoring of the arrival time of Korotkoff sounds (QKD interval) in the prediction of cardiovascular (CV) events. Methods: Twenty-four-hour ambulatory BP and QKD monitoring were recorded at baseline, before antihypertensive treatment of hypertensive patients in our Bordeaux cohort. From these recordings, the AASI, the PP/MBP slope, and the theoretical value of the QKD for a systolic pressure of 100 mm Hg and a heart rate of 60 beats/min (QKD100-60) were calculated. The patients were then given antihypertensive treatment and followed by their family physicians, who were unaware of the QKD, AASI, and PP/MBP slope results. Regular updates on patients were obtained. The reproducibility of measurements was studied in 38 normal subjects evaluated on two occasions. Results: The reproducibility of the AASI and the PP/MBP slope was less than that of BP over 24 h and of QKD100-60. The cohort comprised 469 patients. With an average follow-up of 70 ± 39 months, 62 CV complications, including 13 deaths, were recorded. In the monovariate analysis, age, PP over 24 h, QKD100-60, AASI, and the PP/MBP slope were significantly related to the occurrence of complications. In the multivariate analysis, when age and PP over 24 were included in the model, only QKD100-60 remained significantly linked to CV events. Conclusions: Our data support the value of the AASI as an indirect estimate of AS and as an element in the evaluation of CV risk in hypertensive patients. However, the reproducibility of this index is less, and its predictive value for complications is poorer, than that of QKD100-60, a parameter that we believe is more closely linked to AS. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd.},

abstract = {The stiffness of the aorta can be determined by measuring carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV(cf)). PWV may also influence the contour of the peripheral pulse, suggesting that contour analysis might be used to assess large artery stiffness. An index of large artery stiffness (SI(DVP)) derived from the digital volume pulse (DVP) measured by transmission of IR light (photoplethysmography) was examined. SI(DVP) was obtained from subject height and from the time delay between direct and reflected waves in the DVP. The timing of these components of the DVP is determined by PWV in the aorta and large arteries. SI(DVP) was, therefore, expected to provide a measure of stiffness similar to PWV. SI(DVP) was compared with PWV(cf) obtained by applanation tonometry in 87 asymptomatic subjects (21-68 years; 29 women). The reproducibility of SI(DVP) and PWV(cf) and the response of SI(DVP) to glyceryl trinitrate were assessed in subsets of subjects. The mean within-subject coefficient of variation of SI(DVP), for measurements at weekly intervals, was 9.6{\%}. SI(DVP) was correlated with PWV(cf) ( r =0.65, P {\textless}0.0001). SI(DVP) and PWV(cf) were each independently correlated with age and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) with similar regression coefficients: SI(DVP)=0.63+0.086 x age+0.042 x MAP ( r =0.69, P {\textless}0.0001); PWV(cf)=0.76+0.080 x age+0.053 x MAP ( r =0.71, P {\textless}0.0001). Administration of glyceryl trinitrate (3, 30 and 300 microg/min intravenous; each dose for 15 min) in nine healthy men produced similar changes in SI(DVP) and PWV(cf). Thus contour analysis of the DVP provides a simple, reproducible, non-invasive measure of large artery stiffness.},

abstract = {Objective-To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials involving adults, to determine the effect of weight loss induced by energy restriction with or without exercise, antiobesity drugs or bariatric surgery on pulse wave velocity (PWV) measured at all arterial segments. Approach and Results-A systematic search of Pubmed (1966 to 2014), EMBASE (1947 to 2014), MEDLINE (1946 to 2014), and the Cochrane Library (1951 to 2014) was conducted and the reference lists of identified articles were searched to find intervention trials (randomized/nonrandomized) that aimed to achieve weight loss and included PWV as an outcome. The search was restricted to human studies. Two independent researchers extracted the data. Data were analyzed using Comprehensive Meta Analysis version 2 using random effects analysis. A total of 22 studies were included in the qualitative synthesis and 20 studies (3 randomized controlled trials), involving 1259 participants, were included in the meta-analysis. The standardized mean difference for the overall effect of weight loss on PWV measured at all sites was -0.32 (95{\%} confidence interval, -0.41, -0.24; P=0.0001). Carotid femoral pulse wave velocity (standardized mean difference, -0.35; 95{\%} confidence interval, -0.44, -0.26; P=0.0001; 16 studies) and brachial ankle PWV (standardized mean difference, -0.48; 95{\%} confidence interval, -0.78, -0.18; P=0.002; 5 studies) were improved with weight loss. Meta-regression showed that change in blood pressure was a predictor of change in PWV (P{\textless}0.01). Conclusion-Modest weight loss (mean 8{\%} of initial body weight) achieved with diet and lifestyle measures improved PWV. The results of this meta-analysis suggest that weight loss may reduce PWV, although future research is required.},

abstract = {In the United States, cardiovascular disease, e.g., atherosclerosis and hypertension, that lead to heart failure and stroke, is the leading cause of mortality, accounting for over 40 percent of deaths in those aged 65 years and above. Over 80 percent of all cardio-vascular deaths occur in the same age group. Thus, age, per se, is the major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Clinical manifestations and prognosis of these cardiovascular diseases likely become altered in older persons with advanced age because interactions occur between age-associated cardiovascular changes in health and specific pathophysiologic mechanisms that underlie a disease. A fundamental understanding of age-associated changes in cardiovascular structure and function ranging in scope from humans to molecules is required for effective and efficient prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease in older persons. A sustained effort over the past two decades has been applied to characterize the multiple effects of aging in health on cardiovascular structure and function in a single study population, the Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging. In these studies, community dwelling, volunteer participants are rigorously screened to detect both clinical and occult cardiovascular disease and characterized with respect to lifestyle, e.g. exercise habits, in an attempt to deconvolute interactions among lifestyle, cardiovascular disease and the aging process in health. This review highlights some specific changes in resting cardiovascular structure and function and cardiovascular reserve capacity that occur with advancing age in healthy humans. Observations from relevant experiments in animal models have been integrated with those in humans to provide possible mechanistic insight},

abstract = {Blood flow in arteries is dominated by unsteady flow phenomena. The cardiovas-cular system is an internal flow loop with multiple branches in which a complex liquid circulates. A nondimensional frequency parameter, the Womersley num-ber, governs the relationship between the unsteady and viscous forces. Normal arterial flow is laminar with secondary flows generated at curves and branches. The arteries are living organs that can adapt to and change with the varying hemo-dynamic conditions. In certain circumstances, unusual hemodynamic conditions create an abnormal biological response. Velocity profile skewing can create pock-ets in which the direction of the wall shear stress oscillates. Atherosclerotic dis-ease tends to be localized in these sites and results in a narrowing of the artery lumen—a stenosis. The stenosis can cause turbulence and reduce flow by means of viscous head losses and flow choking. Very high shear stresses near the throat of the stenosis can activate platelets and thereby induce thrombosis, which can totally block blood flow to the heart or brain. Detection and quantification of stenosis serve as the basis for surgical intervention. In the future, the study of arterial blood flow will lead to the prediction of individual hemodynamic flows in any patient, the development of diagnostic tools to quantify disease, and the design of devices that mimic or alter blood flow. This field is rich with challeng-ing problems in fluid mechanics involving three-dimensional, pulsatile flows at the edge of turbulence.},

abstract = {The aim of this research was to assess the validity of the photoplethysmographic (PPG) waveform index PPGAI for the estimation of increased arterial stiffness. For this purpose, PPG signals were recorded from 24 healthy subjects and from 20 type II diabetes patients. The recorded PPG signals were processed with the analysis algorithm developed and the waveform index PPGAI similar to the augmentation index (AIx) was calculated. As a reference, the aortic AIx was assessed and normalized for a heart rate of 75 bpm (AIx@75) by a SphygmoCor device. A strong correlation (r = 0.85) between the PPGAI and the aortic AIx@75 and a positive correlation of both indices with age were found. Age corrections for the indices PPGAI and AIx@75 as regression models from the signals of healthy subjects were constructed. Both indices revealed a significant difference between the groups of diabetes patients and healthy controls. However, the PPGAI provided the best statistical discrimination for the group of subjects with increased arterial stiffness. The waveform index PPGAI based on the inexpensive PPG technology can be considered as a perspective measure of increased arterial stiffness estimation in clinical screenings.},

abstract = {We hypothesized that the dynamic relation between diastolic and systolic blood pressure over 24 hours provides a measure of arterial stiffness and might, therefore, predict cardiovascular mortality over and above pulse pressure. At baseline, while not on antihypertensive medication, 11 291 patients (mean age, 54.6 years; 5965 women) underwent ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Using all of the blood pressure readings, we plotted diastolic against systolic blood pressure from each individual and calculated the regression slope. The ambulatory arterial stiffness index (AASI) was defined as 1 minus this regression slope. Over a median follow-up of 5.3 years, 566 cardiovascular deaths occurred, including 151 from stroke and 358 from cardiac disorders. Before and after adjustment for other cardiovascular risk factors, AASI and pulse pressure significantly predicted total cardiovascular mortality. AASI was a stronger predictor than pulse pressure for stroke (mutually adjusted relative hazard ratios for 1 SD increase, 1.21 versus 1.04; P=0.02 versus 0.66) with the opposite trend for cardiac mortality (relative hazard ratios, 1.03 versus 1.21; P=0.63 versus 0.002). In subjects with normal daytime ambulatory blood pressure ({\textless}135/{\textless}85 mm Hg), AASI was more predictive than pulse pressure of cardiovascular mortality (1.26 versus 0.96; P=0.04 versus 0.70) and of stroke mortality (1.81 versus 1.12; P=0.007 versus 0.58), whereas neither independently predicted cardiac mortality (1.11 versus 0.89; P=0.47 versus 0.40). AASI is a novel measure of arterial stiffness, which can be readily determined from ambulatory blood pressure recordings and which independently predicts cardiovascular mortality, even in normotensive subjects.},

abstract = {The human arterial system in youth is beautifully designed for its role of receiving spurts of blood from the left ventricle and distributing this as steady flow through peripheral capillaries. Central to such design is "tuning" of the heart to arterial tree; this minimizes aortic pressure fluctuations and confines flow pulsations to the larger arteries. With aging, repetitive pulsations (some 30 million/year) cause fatigue and fracture of elastin lamellae of central arteries, causing them to stiffen (and dilate), so that reflections return earlier to the heart; in consequence, aortic systolic pressure rises, diastolic pressure falls, and pulsations of flow extend further into smaller vessels of vasodilated organs (notably the brain and kidney). Stiffening leads to increased left ventricular (LV) load with hypertrophy, decreased capacity for myocardial perfusion, and increased stresses on small arterial vessels, particularly of brain and kidney. Clinical manifestations are a result of diastolic LV dysfunction with dyspnea, predisposition to angina, and heart failure, and small vessel degeneration in brain and kidney with intellectual deterioration and renal failure. While aortic stiffening is the principal cause of cardiovascular disease with age in persons who escape atherosclerotic complications, it is not a specific target for therapy. The principal target is the smooth muscle in distributing arteries, whose relaxation has little effect on peripheral resistance but causes substantial reduction in the magnitude of wave reflection. Such relaxation is achieved through regular exercise and with the vasodilating drugs that are used in modern treatment of hypertension and cardiac failure. {\textcopyright} 2007 American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

abstract = {The non-linear clastic response of arteries implies that their mechanical properties depend strongly on blood pressure. Thus, dynamic measurements of bath the diameter and pressure curves over the whole cardiac cycle arc necessary to characterise properly the elastic behaviour of an artery. Wc propose a novel method of estimating these mechanical properties based on the analysis of the arterial diamctcr against pressure curves derived from ultrasonic and photoplcthysmagraphic mcasuremcnts. An ultrasonic echo tracking device has been, developed that allows continuous recording of the internal diameter of peripheral arteries. It measures the diameter 300 times per second with a resolution of 2.5 pm. This system is linked IO a commercially available light-plethysmograph which continuously records the finger arterial pressure (0.25 kPa accuracy). Because of the finite pulse wave velocity, the separation between the diameter and the pressure measurement sites causes a hysteresis to appear in the recorded diameter-prcssure curve. Using a model based on hacmadynamic considerations, the delay between the diameter variations and the finger arterial pressure is first eliminated. As the pulse wave velocity depends on the pressure, the delay is determined for each pressure value. The relationship between pressure and diameter is then described by a non-linear mathematical , expression with three parameters, which best fits the recorded data. The dynamic local behaviour of the vessel is fully characterised by these parameters. Compliance, distensibility and pulse wave velocity can then he calculated at each pressure level. Thus, the mechanical behaviour of peripheral human arteries can now be characterised non-invasively over the pressure range of the whale cardiac cycle . The results obtained in vivo on human radial and brachial arteries show that a thorough analysis of the compliance-pressure curves and their modifications (curving, shift) is needed in order to compare two different vcssels in a meaningful way.},

abstract = {—We hypothesized that 1 minus the slope of diastolic on systolic pressure during 24-hour ambulatory monitoring (ambulatory arterial stiffness index [AASI]) might reflect arterial stiffness. We compared AASI with established measures of arterial stiffness and studied its distribution in Chinese and European populations. We used 90207 SpaceLabs monitors and the SphygmoCor device to measure AASI, central and peripheral pulse pressures, the central (CAIx) and peripheral (PAIx) systolic augmentation indexes, and aortic pulse wave velocity. In 166 volunteers, the correlation coefficient between AASI and pulse wave velocity was 0.51 (PϽ0.0001). In 348 randomly recruited Chinese subjects, AASI correlated (PϽ0.0001) with CAIx (rϭ0.48), PAIx (rϭ0.50), and central pulse pressure (rϭ0.50). AASI increased with age and mean arterial pressure but decreased with body height. Both before and after adjustment for arterial wave reflections by considering height and heart rate as covariates, AASI correlated more (PϽ0.0001) closely with CAIx and PAIx than 24-hour pulse pressure. Among normotensive subjects, the 95th percentile of AASI was 0.55 in Chinese and 0.57 in 1617 Europeans enrolled in the International Database on Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring. The upper boundary of the 95{\%} prediction interval of AASI in relation to age ranged from 0.53 at 20 years to 0.72 at 80 years. In conclusion, AASI is a new index of arterial stiffness that can be easily measured under ambulatory conditions. Pending additional validation in outcome studies, normal values of AASI are probably Ͻ0.50 and 0.70 in young and older subjects, respectively. (Hypertension. 2006;47:359-364.) S tiffening of large arteries predicts adverse cardiovascular outcomes. 1–3 Until now, measurements of arterial stiff-ness require the use of complex ultrasound equipment or applanation tonometry at the level of the peripheral arteries with the subjects in the supine or sitting position. 4 The QKD approach was the first attempt to estimate arterial compliance under ambulatory conditions by measuring the time interval between the Q-wave on the ECG and the disappearance of the Korotkoff sounds at the brachial artery during cuff deflation. 5 In 1914, MacWilliam and Melvin 6 wrote that loss of elasticity in the arterial system influences the height of the diastolic pressure and its relation to systolic pressure. Along these lines, we hypothesized that the slope of diastolic on systolic pressure during ambulatory monitoring might be a measure of arterial stiffness. We tested this hypothesis in untreated volunteers and in a Chinese population sample. In addition, we compared our findings in Chinese with those in the Belgian and Irish subjects enrolled in the International Database of Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring. 7 In a companion article, 8 we demonstrate that ambulatory arterial stiffness index (AASI) predicts cardiovascular mortality in hypertensive patients and provides prognostic information complementary to pulse pressure, independent of mean arte-rial pressure.},

@article{Trachet2010,
abstract = {Recently a new method has been proposed as a tool to measure arterial pulse wave velocity (PWV), a measure of the stiffness of the large arteries and an emerging parameter used as indicator of clinical cardiovascular risk. The method is based on measurement of brachial blood pressure during supra-systolic pressure inflation of a simple brachial cuff [the device is known as the Arteriograph (Tensiomed, Budapest, Hungary)]. This occlusion yields pronounced first and secondary peaks in the pressure waveform, the latter ascribed to a reflection from the aortic bifurcation, and PWV is calculated as the ratio of twice the jugulum-symphysis distance and the time difference between the two peaks. To test the validity of this working principle, we used a numerical model of the arterial tree to simulate pressures and flows in the normal configuration, and in a configuration with an occluded brachial artery. A pronounced secondary peak was indeed found in the brachial pressure signal of the occluded model, but its timing was only related to brachial stiffness and not to aortic stiffness. We also compared PWV's calculated with three different methods: PWVATG (approximately Arteriograph principle), PWVcar-fem (approximately carotid-femoral PWV, the current clinical gold standard method), and PWVtheor (approximately Bramwell-Hill equation). Both PWVATG (R2=0.94) and PWVcar-fem (R2=0.95) correlated well with PWVtheor, but their numerical values were lower (by 2.17+/-0.42 and 1.08+/-0.70 m/s for PWVATG and PWVcar-fem, respectively). In conclusion, our simulations question the working principle of the Arteriograph. Our data indicate that the method picks up wave reflection phenomena confined to the brachial artery, and derived values of PWV rather reflect the stiffness of the brachial arteries.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: although the isolated effects of age on QT interval and QT dispersion (QTd) have been previously investigated, no data are available on the simultaneous effects of age and other physiological or lifestyle factors on QT interval and QTd in healthy subjects. We studied the effects of age, gender, body mass index, smoking status, and blood pressure on these electrocardiographic parameters. DESIGN: observational study. SETTING: academic medical centre. Participants and measurements: age, gender, body mass index, smoking status, and blood pressure were obtained from 191 consecutive healthy subjects (101 males and 90 females, age range 19-89 years). The subjects were divided into three groups according to their age: {\textless}30 (n=56), 30-65 (n=49), and {\textgreater}65 years (n=86). RESULTS: heart-rate corrected QT interval (QTc, Bazett's formula) progressively increased with advancing age (389+/-3 vs. 411+/-4 vs. 418+/-3 ms, means+/-SEM; P{\textless}0.01). By contrast, no differences in QTd were observed across the three groups (36+/-2 vs. 35+/-3 vs. 40+/-2 ms, P=NS). A multivariate regression analysis showed that age (P{\textless}0.01) and body mass index (P=0.04) independently predicted QT interval while gender was a weak (P=0.09) predictor of QTd. CONCLUSIONS: after adjusting for gender, smoking status, and blood pressure, age and body mass index independently predicted QT interval in healthy subjects. By contrast, age is not a predictor of QTd. The increase of QT interval associated with ageing and body mass index might be secondary to cardiac hypertrophy and myocardial action potential prolongation},

The merits of each technique are described, and a brief overlook of the marketed devices to measure pulse wave velocity is given. ?? 2008 Association for Research into Arterial Structure and Physiology.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Indices of arterial stiffness and aortic pressure are usually assessed by applanation tonometry. The more recently introduced oscillometric device is simpler to use. Several studies have investigated the agreement between these two devices, but not in populations with elevated levels of arterial stiffness. Therefore, we evaluated the agreement in an elderly population with high risk of arterial stiffness. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included a subgroup of the B-PROOF study (n=344, mean age 73 years, 60{\%} men), whose aortic pulse wave velocity (aPWV), aortic augmentation index (AIx), aortic pulse pressure (PP), and aortic systolic blood pressure (SBP) were assessed both with applanation tonometry (SphygmoCor) and with oscillometry (Arteriograph). We investigated agreement between the two devices using Pearson correlations and Bland-Altman analysis. We carried out a stratified analysis in participants with more pronounced arterial stiffness (SphygmoCor aPWV{\textgreater}12 m/s). RESULTS: The oscillometric method produced higher values of AIx, aortic PP, and aortic SBP (P{\textless}0.01) than applanation tonometry. aPWV values were lower (P{\textless}0.01) and were not correlated (r=-0.06, P=0.92), whereas AIx measurements (r=0.35 P{\textless}0.01), aortic PP (r=0.57 P{\textless}0.01), and aortic SBP (r=0.68 P{\textless}0.01) measurements were correlated. Bland-Altman analysis showed insufficient agreement between the two devices, especially in those with elevated levels of arterial stiffness (aPWV{\textgreater}12 m/s). CONCLUSION: Particularly in the elderly with elevated levels of arterial stiffness, measurements of aPWV obtained with oscillometry and applanation tonometry show poor agreement. Also, AIx, aortic SBP, and aortic PP show clearly less than optimal agreement.},

abstract = {With aging there are changes in the cardiovascular system, which result in alterations in cardiovascular physiology. The changes in cardiovascular physiology must be differentiated from the effects of pathology, such as coronary artery disease, that occur with increasing frequency as age increases. The changes with age occur in everyone but not necessarily at the same rate, therefore accounting for the difference seen in some people between chronologic age and physiologic age. The changes in the cardiovascular system associated with aging are a decrease in elasticity and an increase in stiffness of the arterial system. This results in increased afterload on the left ventricle, an increase in systolic blood pressure, and left ventricular hypertrophy, as well as other changes in the left ventricular wall that prolong relaxation of the left ventricle in diastole. There is a dropout of atrial pacemaker cells resulting in a decrease in intrinsic heart rate. With fibrosis of the cardiac skeleton there is calcification at the base of the aortic valve and damage to the His bundle as it perforates the right fibrous trigone. Finally there is decreased responsiveness to beta adrenergic receptor stimulation, a decreased reactivity to baroreceptors and chemoreceptors, and an increase in circulating catecholamines. These changes set the stage for isolated systolic hypertension, diastolic dysfunction and heart failure, atrioventricular conduction defects, and aortic valve calcification, all diseases seen in the elderly.},

abstract = {Ageing is one of the main contributing factors towards increasing arterial stiffness, leading to changes in peripheral pulses propagation. Therefore the characteristics of the photoplethysmogram (PPG) pulse, especially the rising edge and peak position, are greatly affected. In this study, the PPG pulse rising edge and corresponding peak position have been investigated non-invasively in human subjects as a function of age. Fifteen healthy subjects were selected and grouped in five age intervals, from 20 to 59{\~{}}years, based on their comparable systolic-diastolic blood pressure and PPG amplitude. As expected, the peripheral pulse shows a steep rise and early peak in younger subjects. With age, the slope becomes blunted and in older subjects, the rise is very gradual and the pulse peak appears much later. Qualitative results were further verified by a modified 10-element Windkessel model to quantify the lumped parameter changes with ageing. This verification highlighted some specific changes in vascular parameters with aging. The rising edge could be considered as one parameter in determining the age-dependent vascular state.},

Our objective was to determine the multiaxial mechanical characteristics of atherosclerotic plaque and adjacent segment of the common carotid artery.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A novel noninvasive echotracking system was used to measure intima-media thickness, diameter, pulsatile strain, and distensibility at 128 sites on a 4-cm long common carotid artery segment. The study included 62 patients with recent cerebrovascular ischemic event and either a plaque on the far wall of common carotid artery (n=25) or no plaque (n=37).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The mechanical characteristics of the carotid segment devoid of plaque did not differ between the two groups. Among patients with plaque, 16 had a larger radial strain at the level of plaque than at the level of adjacent common carotid artery (pattern A: outward-bending strain). The eight patients who had an opposite pattern (inward-bending strain) were more often dyslipidemic (100{\%} versus 56{\%} P=0.03) and type 2 diabetic (63{\%} versus 12{\%}, P=0.04) than pattern A patients. Strain gradient significantly decreased in parallel with the presence of dyslipidemia and/or type 2 diabetes. Longitudinal gradients of distensibility and Young's elastic modulus were consistent with strain gradients.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia were associated with a stiffer carotid at the level of the plaque than in the adjacent common carotid artery leading to an inward-bending stress. The analysis of plaque mechanics along the longitudinal axis may afford useful information, because repetitive bending strain of an atherosclerotic plaque may fatigue the wall material and result in plaque rupture.},

abstract = {Arterial stiffness is an important determinant of cardiovascular risk. The precise risk factors for arterial stiffening remain unclear. We aimed to identify potential risk factors using prospective exposure data from the Caerphilly Prospective Study. Aortic pulse wave velocity and augmentation index were measured in 825 men and related to current (2004) and baseline (1979-1988) anthropometric, hemodynamic, and biochemical factors. The mean age of the men was 74 years, with an average follow-up of 20 years. The only independent baseline predictors of current velocity were pulse pressure (standardized beta-coefficient: 0.58), C-reactive protein (0.35), glucose (0.25), and waist circumference (0.23). The sole baseline predictor of current augmentation index was fibrinogen (0.78). After additional adjustment for the corresponding current risk factor, pulse wave velocity was best related to cumulative exposure to C-reactive protein, whereas augmentation index was most strongly related to current levels. Velocity was also more strongly correlated with baseline levels of triglycerides and smoking but with current waist circumference. The pulse pressure heart rate product assessed over the whole of 20 years was independently correlated with aortic pulse wave velocity but not augmentation index. Other than blood pressure, established cardiovascular risk factors have only a modest effect on aortic stiffness and wave reflection. Inflammation and the level of repetitive cyclic stress are important predictors of aortic stiffness, whereas wave reflection is predicted by acute inflammation only. Adequate control of pulse pressure and heart rate, as well as reducing inflammation, may, in the long-term, retard aortic stiffening, although this remains to be tested directly.},

Serum cholesterol was determined in a subgroup of 79 subjects (age 17 to 85 years, mean 47 +/- 26 SD). PWV (y in cm/sec) was found to vary with age (x, years) at each of the three locations according to the following regression equations: aorta, y = 9.2x + 615, r = .673 (p less than .001); right arm, y = 4.8x + 998, r = .453 (p less than .001); right leg, y = 5.6x + 791, r = .630 (p less than .001). Systolic, diastolic, mean, and pulse pressures were found to increase with age. PWV also increased with mean supine blood pressure but was not related to serum cholesterol (average 4.49 +/- 0.11 [SEM], mmol/l). Compared with that of Western populations, serum cholesterol tended to be lower at all age groups, systolic pressure higher at ages over 35 years, and PWV higher at all ages. Because change in PWV is directly related to change in arterial compliance, these results indicate that aging and not concomitant atherosclerosis (known to be rare in Asian populations) is the dominant factor associated with reduced arterial compliance and increased left ventricular load in these subjects.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The study determined, in a population-based setting, whether dilatation of the thoracic aorta is an atherosclerosis-related process. BACKGROUND: The role of atherosclerosis in thoracic aortic dilatation and aneurysm formation is poorly defined. METHODS: The dimensions of the thoracic aorta were measured with transesophageal echocardiography in 373 subjects participating in a population-based study (median age 66 years; 52{\%} men). The associations between clinical and laboratory atherosclerosis risk factors, aortic athero sclerotic plaques, and aortic dimensions were examined. RESULTS: Age, male gender, and body surface area (BSA) jointly accounted for 41{\%}, 31{\%}, 38{\%}, and 47{\%} of the variability in diameters of the sinuses of Valsalva, ascending aorta, aortic arch, and descending aorta, respectively. Adjusting for age, gender, and BSA: 1) smoking was associated with a greater aortic arch diameter, and diastolic blood pressure and diabetes were each associated with a greater descending aorta diameter (p {\textless} 0.05); 2) atherosclerotic plaques in the descending aorta were associated with a greater descending aorta diameter (0.18 ?? 0.08-mm increase in diameter per 1-mm increase in plaque thickness; p = 0.02); and 3) minor negative associations were noted between atherosclerotic plaques and risk factors for atherosclerosis and the dimensions of the proximal thoracic aorta. Notably, atherosclerosis risk factors and plaque variables each accounted for {\textless}2{\%} of the variability in aortic dimensions, adjusting for age, gender, and BSA. CONCLUSIONS: Age, gender, and BSA are major determinants of thoracic aortic dimensions. Atherosclerosis risk factors and aortic atherosclerotic plaques are weakly associated with distal aortic dilatation, suggesting that atherosclerosis plays a minor role in aortic dilatation in the population. ?? 2003 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

abstract = {Elevated systemic vascular stiffness is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. It has been sug- gested that the time difference between the two characteristic peaks of the digital volume pulse (DVP) measured at the finger using photoplethysmography is related to the stiffness of the arterial tree, and inversely proportional to the stiffness index (SI). However, the precise physical meaning of the SI and its relation to aortic pulse wave velocity (aPWV) is yet to be ascertained. In this study we investigated numerically the effect of changes in arterial wall stiffness, peripheral resistances, peripheral compliances or peripheral wave reflections on the SI and aPWV. The SI was calculated from the digital area waveform simulated using a nonlinear one-dimensional model of pulse wave propagation in a 75-artery network, which includes the larger arteries of the hand. Our results show that aPWV is affected by changes in aortic stiffness, but the SI is primarily affected by changes in the stiffness of all conduit vessels. Thus, the SI is not a direct substitute for aPWV. Moreover, our results suggest that peripheral reflections in the upper body delay the time of arrival of the first peak in the DVP. The second peak is predominantly caused by the impedance mismatch within the 75 arterial segments, rather than by peripheral reflection},

abstract = {Non-invasive assessment of arterial stiffness through pulse wave velocity (PWV) analysis is becoming common clinical practice. However, the effects of measurement noise, temporal resolution and similarity of the two waveforms used for PWV calculation upon accuracy and variability are unknown. We studied these effects upon PWV estimates given by foot-to-foot, least squared difference, and cross-correlation algorithms. We assessed accuracy using numerically generated blood pressure and flow waveforms for which the theoretical PWV was known to compare with the algorithm estimates. We assessed variability using clinical measurements in 28 human subjects. Wave shape similarity was quantified using a cross correlation-coefficient (CCCoefficient), which decreases with increasing distance between waveform measurements sites. Based on our results, we propose the following criteria to identify the most accurate and least variable algorithm given the noise, resolution and CCCoefficient of the measured waveforms. (1) Use foot-to-foot when the noise-to-signal ratio ≤10{\%}, and/or temporal resolution ≥100 Hz. Otherwise (2) use a least squares differencing method applied to the systolic upstroke.},

abstract = {The aim of this research was to assess the validity of the photoplethysmographic (PPG) waveform index PPGAI for the estimation of increased arterial stiffness. For this purpose, PPG signals were recorded from 24 healthy subjects and from 20 type II diabetes patients. The recorded PPG signals were processed with the analysis algorithm developed and the waveform index PPGAI similar to the augmentation index (AIx) was calculated. As a reference, the aortic AIx was assessed and normalized for a heart rate of 75 bpm (AIx@75) by a SphygmoCor device. A strong correlation (r = 0.85) between the PPGAI and the aortic AIx@75 and a positive correlation of both indices with age were found. Age corrections for the indices PPGAI and AIx@75 as regression models from the signals of healthy subjects were constructed. Both indices revealed a significant difference between the groups of diabetes patients and healthy controls. However, the PPGAI provided the best statistical discrimination for the group of subjects with increased arterial stiffness. The waveform index PPGAI based on the inexpensive PPG technology can be considered as a perspective measure of increased arterial stiffness estimation in clinical screenings.},

abstract = {Everyday clinical cardiovascular evaluation is still largely based on brachial systolic and diastolic pressures. However, several clinical studies have demonstrated the higher diagnostic capacities of the aortic pressure, as well as the need to assess the aortic mechanical properties (e.g., by measuring the aortic pulse wave velocity). In order to fill this gap, we propose to exploit a set of easy-to-obtain physical characteristics to estimate the aortic pressure and pulse wave velocity. To this aim, a large population of virtual subjects is created by a validated mathematical model of the cardiovascular system. Quadratic regressive models are then fitted and statistically selected in order to obtain reliable estimations of the aortic pressure and pulse wave velocity starting from the knowledge of the subject age, height, weight, brachial pressure, photoplethysmographic measures and either electrocardiogram or phonocardiogram. The results are very encouraging and foster clinical studies aiming to apply a similar technique to a real population.},

abstract = {Atherosclerosis is the leading cause of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the Western world. In the early development of atherosclerosis, vessel walls remodel outwardly such that the vessel luminal diameter is minimally affected by early plaque development. Only in the late stages of the disease does the vessel lumen begin to narrow-leading to stenoses. As a result, angiographic techniques are not useful for diagnosing early atherosclerosis. Given the absence of stenoses in the early stages of atherosclerosis, CVD remains subclinical for decades. Thus, methods of diagnosing atherosclerosis early in the disease process are needed so that affected patients can receive the necessary interventions to prevent further disease progression. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) is a biomarker directly related to vessel stiffness that has the potential to provide information on early atherosclerotic disease burden. A number of clinical methods are available for evaluating global PWV, including applanation tonometry and ultrasound. However, these methods only provide a gross global measurement of PWV-from the carotid to femoral arteries-and may mitigate regional stiffness within the vasculature. Additionally, the distance measurements used in the PWV calculation with these methods can be highly inaccurate. Faster and more robust magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences have facilitated increased interest in MRI-based PWV measurements. This review provides an overview of the state-of-the-art in MRI-based PWV measurements. In addition, both gold standard and clinical standard methods of computing PWV are discussed.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) is considered the gold standard measure of arterial stiffness, representing mainly aortic stiffness. As compared with the elastic carotid and aorta, the more muscular femoral artery may be differently associated with cardiovascular risk factors (CV-RFs), or, as shown in a recent study, provide additional predictive information beyond carotid-femoral PWV. Still, clinical application is hampered by the absence of reference values. Therefore, our aim was to establish age and sex-specific reference values for femoral stiffness in healthy individuals and to investigate the associations with CV-RFs.$\backslash$nMETHODS: Femoral artery distensibility coefficient, the inverse of stiffness, was calculated as the ratio of relative diastolic-systolic distension (obtained from ultrasound echo-tracking) and pulse pressure among 5069 individuals (49.5{\%} men, age range: 15-87 years). Individuals without cardiovascular disease (CVD), CV-RFs and medication use (n = 1489; 43{\%} men) constituted a healthy subpopulation used to establish sex-specific equations for percentiles of femoral artery distensibility coefficient across age.$\backslash$nRESULTS: In the total population, femoral artery distensibility coefficient Z-scores were independently associated with BMI, mean arterial pressure (MAP) and total to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ratio. Standardized $\beta$s, in men and women, respectively, were -0.18 [95{\%} confidence interval (95{\%} CI) -0.23 to -0.13] and -0.19 (-0.23 to -0.14) for BMI; -0.13 (-0.18 to -0.08) and -0.05 (-0.10 to -0.01) for MAP; and -0.07 (-0.11 to -0.02) and -0.16 (-0.20 to -0.11) for total-to-HDL cholesterol ratio.$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: In young and middle-aged men and women, normal femoral artery stiffness does not change substantially with age up to the sixth decade. CV-RFs related to metabolic disease are associated with femoral artery stiffness.},

Dynamic measurements of wall elasticity and viscosity were made which indicated a high viscosity in the femoral arteries. This was attributed to their high content of muscle. Although the "young" group showed, at any given pressure, an increasing wall stiffness towards the periphery, in "old" arteries, an opposite trend was found. When dimensional changes (radius and wall thickness) in the "old" group were considered it was apparent that at all sites the arterial wall tissue became weaker with age. Nevertheless, as a consequence of these dimensional changes the impedance characteristics of the old arterial tree still retained the nonuniformity (an increase towards the periphery) of the "young" which has considerable haemodynamic advantage.},

abstract = {Early vascular ageing is common in patients with hypertension and increased burden of cardiovascular risk factors, often influenced by chronic inflammation. One aspect of this vascular ageing is arterial stiffening, as measured by increased pulse wave velocity or augmentation index and central pressure. Several studies have indicated that this process starts early in life and that arterial function and ageing properties could be programmed during foetal life or influenced by adverse growth patterns in early postnatal life. This could explain the repeated findings in observational epidemiology that an inverse association exists between birth weight, adjusted for gestational age, and systolic blood pressure elevation in childhood, adolescence and adulthood, as well as for increased cardiovascular risk. One new marker of increased pulse pressure and arterial ageing is telomere length, as regulated by telomerase enzymatic activity. Future studies will hopefully shed light on the possibilities to halt or even reverse vascular ageing, and thereby also influence telomere biology and its different expressions.},

Animal studies demonstrate prolonged tension development, impaired relaxation, and diminished response to receptor-mediated inotropic interventions in the cardiac muscle of senescent animals.

Increased impedance to ejection may result in the modest concentric left ventricular hypertrophy seen in the elderly. Despite changes in cardiovascular function, resting and exercising cardiac outputs are well maintained in healthy elderly individuals who are free of occult coronary artery disease. The reduction in maximal oxygen consumption appears secondary to altered peripheral oxygen utilization rather than to cardiac causes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Regular aerobic exercise prevents and reverses arterial stiffening, but the association between resistance training and arterial stiffness is unclear. AIM: This study was performed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) assessing the associations between resistance training and changes in arterial stiffness. METHODS: MEDLINE and SPORTDiscus databases were searched from January 1980 through to April 2011. RCTs evaluating the ability of resistance training to increase arterial stiffness in comparison with a control group were included in the meta-analysis. Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed the quality of the included studies. Data from 185 reports of eight RCTs (193 participants) were included. Pooled mean differences in arterial stiffness indices (carotid arterial $\beta$ stiffness and pulse wave velocity (PWV)) between intervention and control groups were calculated using a random-effects model. RESULTS: The overall association of resistance training versus control with relative changes in carotid $\beta$ index or PWV (eight studies; 193 participants) was 10.7{\%} (95{\%} CI 3.4{\%} to 18.0{\%}; I(2), 89{\%}; heterogeneity, p{\textless}0.001). Five studies indicated that resistance training in young subjects (n=115) was significantly associated with an increase in stiffness index of 14.3{\%} (95{\%} CI 8.5{\%} to 20.1{\%}; I(2), 71{\%}; heterogeneity, p{\textless}0.001) compared with controls. However, three studies showed that resistance training in middle-aged subjects (n=78) was not associated with changes in arterial stiffness. In addition, although high-intensity resistance training (n=87) was significantly associated with an increase in stiffness of 11.6{\%}, moderate-intensity resistance training (n=106) showed no such association. CONCLUSION: High-intensity resistance training is associated with increased arterial stiffness in young subjects with low baseline levels of arterial stiffness.},

abstract = {Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV), a measure of large artery stiffness, is an important predictor of cardiovascular events. This has been attributed to it being an integrative measure of the impact of cardiovascular risk factors on the arterial wall. Pulse wave velocity is strongly associated with age and blood pressure. However, findings with regard to its relation with other risk factors have been inconsistent. We performed a systematic review of cross-sectional published literature reporting independent associations of cfPWV in multivariable regression models. Articles were selected from a PubMed search using a prespecified search strategy. Studies were included if they did the following: (1) measured cfPWV; (2) reported on associations with cfPWV from regression models; and (3) considered age and blood pressure in the model. From 637 retrieved articles, 65 met our inclusion criteria, and 12 studies were included from reference searches. Age and blood pressure were consistently independently associated with cfPWV (91{\%} and 90{\%} of studies, respectively). Diabetes mellitus was associated with cfPWV in 52{\%} studies, but the strength of the association was low. The majority of studies found no independent association between cfPWV and sex, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, smoking, or body mass index. The contribution of risk factors other than age and blood pressure to cfPWV is, thus, small or insignificant. The prognostic value of cfPWV may relate to a process of arterial ageing unrelated to classic risk factors other than hypertension.},

abstract = {The ability to identify premature arterial stiffening is of considerable value in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases. The "ageing index" (AGI), which is calculated from the second derivative photoplethysmographic (SDPPG) waveform, has been used as one method for arterial stiffness estimation and the evaluation of cardiovascular ageing. In this study, the new SDPPG analysis algorithm is proposed with optimal filtering and signal normalization in time. The filter parameters were optimized in order to achieve the minimal standard deviation of AGI, which gives more effective differentiation between the levels of arterial stiffness. As a result, the optimal low-pass filter edge frequency of 6 Hz and transitionband of 1 Hz were found, which facilitates AGI calculation with a standard deviation of 0.06. The study was carried out on 21 healthy subjects and 20 diabetes patients. The linear relationship (r = 0.91) between each subject's age and AGI was found, and a linear model with regression line was constructed. For diabetes patients, the mean AGI value difference from the proposed model y AGI was found to be 0.359. The difference was found between healthy and diabetes patients groups with significance level of P {\textless} 0.0005.},

Suggests an improved approach to filtering the PPG signal in order to ensure that the detected a, b, c, d and e waves are reliably identified, and thus quantify the aging index},
